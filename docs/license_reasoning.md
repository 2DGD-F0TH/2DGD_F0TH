This project is meant to be a free source of knowledge for who wants to develop their first game (but also be a reference book you can come back to), currently this project is under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License.

### Why this license?

Because I want all contributions to be accessible by everyone for free but at the same time for the contributors to be given recognition, simple as that.

The chosen license is not a "Free Culture" license, but I want to protect the "free as in price" policy of this project, as well as the "free as in freedom" one. I feel this license is the best compromise.
