### How to contribute

If you want to contribute to this project, you can follow this procedure.

1) Fork this repository to your own account
2) Check out the *develop* branch with `git checkout develop`
3) Create a new branch with a descriptive name, for instance: `git checkout -b fixes/procedural`
4) Write your contribution
5) Create a Pull Request on the main repository.

### Requirements

There are some requirements the contributions need to meet to be added to the book.

- Algorithms **must** be written in pseudo-code first, in a platform agnostic way. (If you want to put other type of code, like C++ or Python, you can, but there must be a pseudo-code version first).
- All algorithms **must** have at least a big-O estimate of their worst case, other estimates in addition to this one are welcome.
- You should avoid using overly technical terms, if possible. If that is not possible, then you should define such term in the "Glossary" appendix of the book and add a ~[g]~ at the end of the term (so that the reader knows such term is in the glossary).

These are not strict requirements, as in they won't make your pull request get rejected, but you will be asked to fix some things.
