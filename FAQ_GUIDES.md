F.A.Q. and Guides

I can't export my diagrams to Vector PDF, what do I do?
--------------------------------------------------------

If you can't export your diagrams in PDF, try exporting them in the `*.eps` format and then use pdflatex's `epspdf` tool, like follows:

`epspdf file_name.eps`

Some warnings may pop out, check the resulting pdf and if all is good, you can now add it to the book.
