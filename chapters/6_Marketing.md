Marketing your game
====================

<!-- Mostly explain that the publisher mentality of "getting all the money" is wrong and not
appliable to small indie developers, and how the success of a game is based more on customer
satisfaction than mere sales -->

The importance of being pro-consumer
------------------------------------

<!-- Give the programmer a view on how they are not EA or Ubisoft, and if they
make a bad move (or even an illegal one - see Brutal Force raising prices during sales)
they can't just "take the hit" and walk away with no (or minor) consequences -->

Managing Hype
--------------

Downloadable Content
--------------------

<!-- Talk how DLC can make or break a game's fame, like how a DLC can extend and
"give new life" to a game, or if a game is broken down and "spoon-fed" to the user
that can be detrimental to its marketing -->

Digital Rights Management (DRM)
--------------------------

<!-- Talk about how drm can protect your software, but if badly implemented,
it can weigh on your game's performance and even drive away
consumers if it's something known to spy on its users -->

Free-to-Play Economies and LootBoxes
------------------------------------

<!-- Talk about how to avoid predatory EA-style lootboxes and how again microtransactions
can "make or break" a game's fame. How overwatch (Blizzard) implemented a mechanism of
lootboxes that can be (debatably, obviously) considered "acceptable" and how some publishers
are trying to "move the goal further" to earn more money -->
