Cutscenes
---------

When you want to advance your storyline, a great tool is surely the undervalued cutscene. The game temporarily limits its interactivity and becomes more "movie-like", making the storyline go forward. Cutscenes can be scripted or just true video files; in this chapter we will analyze the difference between the two, advantages and disadvantages of both and how to implement each one, from a high-level perspective.

### Videos

The easiest way to implement cutscenes in most engines and frameworks, is to use videos. Many frameworks have native support for reproducing multimedia files with just a few lines of code, which makes this the preferred choice when it comes to the code.

The bad thing is that videos are a "static" format. They have their own resolution, their own compression and characteristics, this means that when a video is presented at a higher resolution that is own native one, we're bound to have artifacts due to upscaling.
