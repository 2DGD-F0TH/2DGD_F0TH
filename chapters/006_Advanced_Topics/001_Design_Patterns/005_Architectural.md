Architectural Design Patterns
-----------------------------

Architectural patterns are a category of design patterns that provide reusable solutions to recurring problems in creating software systems and structures. They can address problems like minimizing a defined risk or dealing with performance limitations, for instance.

### Service Locator

The service locator pattern is very useful when you need to manage connections between objects, usually at runtime: instead of hard-coding each reference of each service, you have a "central hub" that you can ask such connections to.

This allows you to swap out (or modify) individual parts of your program without affecting the rest of your software, which can prove useful for testing.
