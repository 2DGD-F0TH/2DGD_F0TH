Design Patterns
================

:::::: {.epigraph author="Rich Hickey"}
Patterns mean "I have run out of language."
::::::

Design Patterns are essentially "pre-made solutions for known problems" and can help decoupling elements of your game, increasing maintainability.

:::: note ::::
This book will introduce design patterns as they were explained in the famous "Gang of Four" book: "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". In some languages (for instance ones that have functions as first-class objects) such patterns can take different forms. This book will tell you which pattern does what, along with a rough implementation, but it's up to you to check the most efficient one in your favourite language.

:::: pitfall ::::
When people find out about design patterns, they usually come up with the "everything is a nail syndrome". Don't overuse design patterns only because it looks "cool" or "because it may solve a future problem". What matters is your game, right now.

Design patterns are not a cure-all, they can introduce overhead and could lead to over-engineering: balance is key when it comes to creating a game (or any software in general).

Leave future problems to your future self.
