Glossary
========

A
--

API
: Short for "Application Programming Interface", it's a set of definitions, tools and clearly defined methods of communication between various software components.

E
--

EULA
: Short of "End User License Agreement", is essentially a contract that estabilishes the purchaser's right to use the software, usually with some limitations on how the copy can be used.

G
--

Greedy Algorithms
: Class of algorithms that try to solve a problem by making the locally optimal choice **at each stage**, approximating the global solution, without any global planning.

H
--

HUD
: Short of "Heads Up Display", in games it usually shows your health, ammunition, minimap and other information.

I
--

IDE
: Short for "Integrated Development Environment", it is a program that integrates a text editor with syntax highlighting, a compiler, a code checker, a project explorer and other features (like a tag explorer, for instance).

K
--

Kanboard
: Short for "Kanban Board", are boards used to manage work. The board is usually divided into swimlanes and "cards" that represent the work to do are moved from left to right, to represent the progress of the work itself.

M
--

Malware
: Short for "malicious software", it's a "catchall term" for viruses, trojan horses and any kind of software that is programmed to behave maliciously. Such software can steal information (passwords, key presses, habits, etc...) or flat out try to make your computer unusable (deleting system files, encrypting your documents and asking for a ransom, etc...)

R
--

Race Condition
: A condition where two or more threads are competing for a resource (variable, screen buffer, ...) and the order that the threads happen to take hold of such resource changes the result.

Rootkit
: Usually associated with malware, a rootkit is a software that manages to get access to reserved areas of an operating system, usually to hide its own, or other softwares' presence.

S
--

Stack Overflow
: A stack overflow is a situation where too much data is pushed into a data structure called a "stack". One of the most common cases of "stack overflow" happens during recursion: when a function is called all the current work variables are saved and pushed into a stack data structure in memory, along with a "return address" that will allow us to come back to this point of the program. When a recursion is too deep (the recursive function calls itself too many times), the call stack gets filled up and it's not able to continue the execution, leading to an aborted operation.

Static Typing
: Languages characterized by *static typing* are the ones where the type of a certain variable (integer, string, class, ...) is known at compile time.

U
--

UI
: Short of *User Interface*, defines the elements shown to and interacted by the user in a software or, in this case, a videogame menu.

W
--

Wiki
: A wiki usually refers to a knowledge base website where users collaboratively modify content and structure by using their own web browsers.
