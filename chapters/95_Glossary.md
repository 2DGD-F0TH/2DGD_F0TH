Malware
: Short for "malicious software", it's a "catchall term" for viruses, trojan horses and any kind of software that is programmed to behave maliciously. Such software can steal information (passwords, key presses, habits, etc...) or flat out try to make your computer unusable (deleting system files, encrypting your documents and asking for a ransom, etc...)

Rootkit
: Usually associated with malware, a rootkit is a software that manages to get access to reserved areas of an operating system, usually to hide its own, or other softwares' presence.
