Finite State Machine
---------------------

A finite state machine is a model of computation that represents an abstract machine with a finite number of possible states but where one (or a finite number) of states can be "in execution" at a given time.

We can use a finite state machine to represent the status of a player character, like in the following diagram:

Each state machine is made out of two main elements:

- **states** which define a certain state of the system (for the diagram above, the states are: Idle, Crouching, Jumping and Stomping);
- **transitions** which define a condition and the change of state of the machine (for the diagram above there are two "Press Down" transitions, one "Release Down" and one "Press Space")

State machines are really flexible and can be used to represent a menu system, for instance:

![Diagram of a menu system's state machine](./images/patterns_containers/Menu_SM.pdf){width=70%}

In this more convoluted diagram we can see how pressing a certain button or clicking a certain option can trigger a state change.

Each state can be created so it has its own member variables and methods: in a menu system it can prove useful to have each state have its own `update(dt)` and `draw()` functions to be called from the main game loop, to improve on the code readability and better usage of the nutshell programming principle.
