Developer Experience (DX/DevEx)
-------------------------------

Much like "user experience", developer experience (DevEx for short) is something that should be kept in high regard.

Developer experience encompasses everything that concerns the interaction between a developer and their work environment, which could be their tools, the work environment including culture, and anything that could affect their productivity and satisfaction.

This may also include the code itself: good code breeds other good code, while bad code will encourage bad practices (similar to the "Broken Window Principle").

What to do when coding
----------------------

Here are some small universal tips that you can use when coding that will help you, no matter the programming language you're in. These will usually avoid a lot of headaches by covering cases that may get overlooked or by giving guidance on how to solve some problems.

### Safe default initialization

What to avoid when coding
-------------------------

Here are some examples of what are usually considered "universally bad practices" when coding, no matter the language you're using. There are usually referred as "code smells" and should be avoided as much as possible (but nothing is imperative in programming).

### Code monoliths

<!-- TODO: Talk about how having huge files/classes/functions may make things harder to maintain and how they probably violate the single responsibility principle -->
