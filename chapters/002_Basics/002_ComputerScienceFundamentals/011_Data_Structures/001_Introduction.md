Generic Programming
-------------------

Sometimes it may be necessary (mostly in the case of containers) to have the same kind of code to work on different data types, which means that we need to **abstract types into variables** and be able to code accounting for such types.

**Generic Programming** is a blanket-term that defines a style of computer programming where algorithms are written in terms of "to be specified later" data types, this usually applies to languages that make use of *[static typing~\[g\]~](#gl_statictyping)*.
