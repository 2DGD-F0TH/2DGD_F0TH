Object Oriented Programming
----------------------------

### Introduction

One of the biggest programming paradigms in use is surely the "Object Oriented Programming" (from now on: "O.O.P.") paradigm. The fundamental unit of a program, in this paradigm is the *Object*. This paradigm allows to structure your code in a more modular and re-usable way, as well as implementing abstractions, allowing for more solid code and making it possible for other code to make use of your own code without needing to know any details besides its *Interface*.

### Objects

Objects are the fundamental unit in O.O.P., objects are essentially a collection of data and functions. Objects are actually the physical instantiation of what is called a "Class".

To simplify the concept: a "Class" is a house blueprint, an "Object" is the house itself.

Objects contain data and functions, for the sake of precision, we will use their technical names:

- Functions that are part of an object are called **methods** and they can be classified as:
    - *Instance Methods* when they act on a single object instance;
    - *Static Methods* when they don't (usually they're utility functions), that also means that these methods belong to the Class itself and not to its instance.
- Each piece of data contained in the class is called a **Field** and they can be classified as:
    - *Instance Fields* when they're part of the instance and can change from instance to instance;
    - *Static Fields* when they're part of the class but don't change between instances (**Caution:** it does not mean they cannot change, in that case the change will snowball into all the instances).

### Abstraction and Interfaces

Abstraction is a fundamental point in O.O.P., and it is usually taken care of via so-called **Interfaces**.

Interfaces are the front-end that an object offers to other objects so they can interact.

As an example: the interface to your PC is given by Keyboard, Mouse and Screen - you don't need to know how the single electron travels through the circuits to be able to use a computer; same goes for a class that offers a well-abstracted interface.

Being able to abstract a concept, removing the necessity to know the internal workings of the code that is used, is fundamental to be able to write solid and maintainable code, because implementations change, but interfaces rarely do.

Making classes work together with interfaces allows you to modify and optimize your code without having each edit snowball into a flurry of compiler (or interpreter) errors. For instance: a rectangle class exposes in its interface a method `getArea()` - you don't need to know how to calculate the area, you just call that method and know it will return the area of the rectangle.

The concept of keeping the internal workings of a class is called *Information Hiding*.

### Inheritance and Polymorphism

One of the biggest aspects of O.O.P. is **inheritance**: you can create other classes based on a so-called "base class", allowing for extensibility of your software.

You can create a "Person" class, with a name, surname and age as fields, and by inheriting from the "Person" class you can create a "Student" class, which has all the fields from Person, plus the "clubs" and "grade" fields.

This allows to create a "tree of classes" that represents part of your software.

From inheritance, O.O.P. presents a concept called **Polymorphism** (From "Poly" - Many, "Morph" - Shape), where you can use the base class to represent the entire class tree, allowing for substitution.

In our "Person-Student" example, you could use a pointer to either a Person or a Student for the sake of getting their first name.

In some languages it is possible for an object to inherit from multiple other objects, this is called "Multiple Inheritance"

### Mixins

Mixins are classes that contain certain methods that are made to be used by other classes. We can see mixins as some kind of interface with methods already implemented.

Mixins encourage the reuse of code (since the common functionalities get separated into their own classes), allowing for some interesting mechanisms and enforcing the Dependency Inversion principle.

Many times, Mixins are described as "included" rather than "inherited", due to their nature.

:::: trivia ::::
The python web framework Django makes heavy use of mixins in its class-based views: you can create a standard "View" (representing a web page, for instance), and then add login protection (via LoginRequiredMixin) or permissions (via PermissionRequiredMixin). This is all done using Python's multiple inheritance.
::::

A code example of mixins is beyond the scope of this book, since each language has its own way of implementing mixins, some easy (like Python), other a bit more complex (like C++, see "Curiously Recurring Template Patterns", or C.R.T.P.).

### The Diamond Problem {#diamondproblem}

Usually when you call a method that is not present in the object itself, the program will look through the object's parents for the method to execute. This usually works well when there is no ambiguity, but what if it happens?

When multiple inheritance is involved, there is a serious possibility of a situation similar to the following

![Example of a diamond problem](./images/computer_science/diamond.svg){width=20%}

In this example, class A implements a method `dostuff()` that is overrode by both classes B and C (which inherit from A): now class D inherits from both B and C but does not override `dostuff()`, which one will be chosen?

This is the reason many languages do not implement multiple inheritance between classes (like Java, which allows multiple inheritance only between interfaces), other implement the so-called "virtual inheritance" (C++) and others again use an ordered list to solve the problem (Python).

This is not something you usually need to worry about, but you may want to be careful when you structure your classes to avoid "diamond problems", so to avoid headaches.

### Composition {#composition}

As opposed to inheritance's "IS-A" relationship, composition makes use of a "HAS-A" type of relationship.

Composition allows to define objects by declaring which properties they have: a player character can be a sprite with a "Movable" component, or a box could have a "RigidBody" component.

This way we can create new objects by reusing basic components, making maintenance easier as well as saving lines of code, avoiding "the diamond problem" and reducing coupling.

#### "Composition over Inheritance" design

Often cited in programming, the "composition over inheritance" design states that code reuse and polymorphism should be achieved using composition as the preferred method, while leaving subclassing (inheritance) alone as much as possible.

This allows for easier code reuse, as well as more flexibility and less coupling. Let's make a simple example.

:::: note ::::
If you're having trouble understanding the diagrams that follow, head to the [Reading UML Diagrams](#uml) section for a full explanation on UML.
::::::::::::::

Let's imagine a physical object that can be Visible/Invisible, Solid/NonSolid and Movable/Immovable. In UML, an inheritance hierarchy would look something like this:

![How an object may look using inheritance](./images/computer_science/compo_inheritance_1.svg){width=60%}

If we think of some objects, like a playable character, or a building, things get a lot more complicated: a playable character is movable, solid and visible, while the building is not movable. Things can get ugly really fast.

![How inheritance can get complicated quickly](./images/computer_science/compo_inheritance_2.svg){width=60%}

This can lead to confusion, as well as the [diamond problem](#diamondproblem).

Using composition, we can separate the behaviours into the "Visible", "Updatable" and "Movable" components and then use those as "reusable puzzle pieces" for our objects.

### Coupling {#coupling}

Coupling is a term used to define the phenomenon where an edit to some part of a software snowballs into a bunch of edits in parts of the software that depend on the modified part, and the part that depend on the previously edited dependency, etc...

The parts involved are defined as "coupled" because, even though they are separated, their maintenance very much behaves like they were a single entity. This also means that the elements that are coupled are harder to reuse, since they are so tightly related that they end up serving each other and nothing else.

Introducing unnecessary coupling in our software will come back to bite us in the future, affecting maintainability in a very negative way, since any edit we make (for instance, to fix a bug) can potentially lead to edit the rest of the software (or game) we are writing.

Reducing coupling is done by reducing interdependence, coordination and information flow between elements of a program.

Examples of coupling include:

- A module uses code of another module (this breaks the principle of *[information hiding~\[g\]~](#gl_infohiding)*);
- Many modules access the same global data;
- A module controls the flow of another module (like passing a parameter that decides "what to do");
- Subclassing.

This means that it's in our best interest to reduce code coupling as much as possible, following the good principles of "nutshell programming" and following the SOLID principles, shown next.

:::: note ::::
We may be tempted to try and "remove coupling completely", but that's usually a wasted effort. We want to reduce coupling as much as possible and instead improve "cohesion". Sometimes coupling is unavoidable (as in case of subclassing). Balance is the key.

### The DRY Principle

DRY is a mnemonic acronym that stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself" and condenses in itself the principle of reducing repetition inside a software, replacing it with *abstractions* and by *normalizing data*.

This allows for each piece of code (and knowledge, since the DRY principle applies to documentation too) to be unambiguous, centralizing its responsibilities and avoiding repetition.

Violations of the DRY principle are called "WET" (write everything twice) solutions, which base themselves on repetition and give higher chances of mistakes and inconsistency.

### SOLID Principles

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym that condenses five principles of good design, to make code and software that is understandable, flexible and maintainable.

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class should have a single responsibility, it should take care of one part of the software specification and each change to said specification should affect only said class. This means you should avoid the so-called "God Classes", classes that take care of too much, know too much about the system and in a nutshell: have too much responsibility in your software.
- **Open-closed Principle**: Each software entity should be open to extension, but closed for modification. This means that each class (for instance) should be extensible, either via inheritance or composition, but it should not be possible to modify the class's code. This is practically enforcing *Information Hiding*.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes and the correctness of the program should not be affected. This is the base of inheritance and polimorphism, if by substituting a base class with one of its child (which should have a Child-is-a-Base relationship, for instance "Circle is a shape") the program is not correct anymore, either something is wrong with the program, or the classes should not be in a "IS-A" relationship.
- **Interface Segregation**: Classes should provide many specific interfaces instead of one general-purpose interface, this means that no client should depend on methods that it doesn't use. This makes the software easier to refactor and maintain, and reduces coupling.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Software components should depend on abstractions and not concretions. This is another staple of nutshell programming and O.O.P. - Each class should make use of some other class's interface, not its inner workings. This allows for maintainability and easier update and change of code, without having the changes snowball into an Armageddon of errors.

Designing entities as data {#entitiesasdata}
-------------------

Sometimes it can be useful to design your entities as data, instead of making them into static objects that possibly require a new release of your product.

Designing your objects as data allows you to use configuration files to create, configure, tinker and extend your product, as well as allow for modifications by people who are fans of your game.

For instance, in a fantasy RPG you could have 3 types of enemies all defined as classes:

- Skeleton
- Zombie
- Ghost Swordsman

Which all have the same behavior but different animations and sprites.

These classes can inherit from an "entity" abstract class which defines the base behavior and then can be extended to create each unique enemy.

Another idea could be designing an "entity" class that can be instantiated, and have a configuration file that defines what each entity is and what its properties are.

An idea could be the following, using YAML:

```{.yaml caption="Example of an entity declared as YAML data"}
entity:
  name: skeleton
  health: 10
  damage_on_hit: 2.5
  spritesheet: "./skelly.png"
  animations:
    walking:
      start_sprite: 4
      frame_no: 4
      duration: 0.2
    attacking:
      start_sprite: 9
      frame_no: 2
      duration: 0.1
```

Another often used alternative is JSON, which would look like this:

```{.json caption="Example of an entity declared as JSON data"}
{
    "entity": {
        "name": "skeleton",
        "health": 10,
        "damage_on_hit": 2.5,
        "spritesheet": "./skelly.png",
        "animations":{
            "walking":{
                "start_sprite": 4,
                "frame_no": 4,
                "duration": 0.2
            },
            "attacking":{
                "start_sprite": 9,
                "frame_no": 2,
                "duration": 0.1
            }
        }
    }
}
```

With more complex building algorithms, it is possible to change behaviors and much more with just a configuration file, and this gives itself well to rogue-like games, which random selection of enemies can benefit from an extension of the enemy pool. In fact, it's really easy to configure a new type of enemy and have it work inside the game without recompiling anything.

This allows for more readable code and a higher extensibility.
