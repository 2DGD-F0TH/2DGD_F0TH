Reading UML diagrams
--------------------

UML (Universal Modeling Language) is a set of graphical tools that allow a team to better organize and plan a software product. Diagrams are drawn in such a way to give the reader an overall assessment of the situation described while being easy to read and understand.

In this chapter we will take a look at 4 diagrams used in UML:

- Use Case Diagrams
- Class Diagrams
- Activity Diagrams
- Sequence Diagrams

### Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are usually used in software engineering to gather requirements for the software that will come to exist. In the world of game development, use case diagrams can prove useful to have an "outside view" of our game, and understand how an user can interact with our game.

Here is an example of a use case diagram for a game:

![Example of a use case diagram](./images/computer_science/use_case.svg){width=60%}

#### Actors {#UMLUserCaseActors}

Actors are any entity that can interface with our system (in this case, our game) without being part of it. Actors can both be human, machines or even other systems.

Actors are represented with a stick figure and can inherit from each other: this will create an "IS-A" relationship between actors.

![Example of an actor hierarchy](./images/computer_science/actors.svg){width=20%}

In the previous example, we can see that a "Free User" is an "Authenticated User", as well as a "Power User" (which could be a paying user) is itself an "Authenticated User" while an "Ultimate User" (which could be a higher tier of paying user) is a "Power User" (thus has all the "Power User" capabilities, plus some unique) and by transitive property an "Authenticated User".

As seen, inheritance between actors is represented with a solid line with a hollow closed arrow. Such arrow points towards the "super-type" or "parent" from which the subject (or "sub-type", or "child") inherits.

This representation will come back in the UML language for other diagrams too.

#### Use Cases

Use cases represent the functionalities that our system offers, and the relationships between them.

Use cases are represented with an ellipse with the name of the use case inside. Choosing the right name for a use case is extremely important, since they will represent the functionality that will be developed in our game.

![Example of a use case](./images/computer_science/use_case_single.svg){width=15%}

##### Inheritance

As with many other elements used in UML, use cases can inherit from each other. Inheritance (also called "Generalisation") is represented with a closed hollow arrow that points towards the parent use case.

![Example of a use case hierarchy](./images/computer_science/use_case_hierarchy.svg){width=40%}

##### Extensions

Use case extensions specify how and when optional behaviour takes place. Extended use cases are meaningful on their own and are independent from the extending use case, while the extending use case define the optional behaviour that may not have much sense by itself.

Extensions are represented via a dashed line with an open arrow on the end, labelled with the `<<extend>>` keyword, pointing towards the extending use case.

![Example of a use case extension](./images/computer_science/use_case_extension.svg){width=40%}

##### Inclusions

Inclusions specify how the behaviour of the included use case is inserted in the behaviour of the including use case. Inclusions are usually used to simplify large use cases by splitting them or extract common behaviours of two or more use cases.

In this situation, the including use case **is not** complete by itself.

Inclusions are represented via a dashed line with an open arrow on the end, labelled with the `<<include>>` pointing towards the included use case.

![Example of a use case inclusion](./images/computer_science/use_case_inclusion.svg){width=40%}

#### Notes

In use case diagrams, as well as in many other UML diagrams, notes are used to jot down conditions, comments and everything useful to better understanding the diagram that cannot be conveyed through a well definite structure inside of UML.

Notes are shaped like a sheet of paper with a folded corner and are usually connected to the diagram with a dashed line. Each note can be connected to more than one piece of the diagram.

You can see a note at the beginning of this chapter, in the use case diagram explanation.

#### Sub-Use Cases

Use cases can be further detailed by creating sub-use cases, like the following example.

![Example of a sub-use case](./images/computer_science/subuse_case.svg){width=40%}

### Class Diagrams

#### Classes

Class diagrams are used a step after analysing your game, since they are used for planning classes. The central element of a class diagram is the "class", which is represented as follows:

![Example of classes in UML](./images/computer_science/class_example.svg){width=60%}

Classes are made up by a class name, which is shown on top of the class; abstract classes are shown with a name in *italics*.

Public members are highlighted by a "+" symbol (or in our case, a green symbol) before their name, protected members use a "#" symbol (or a yellow symbol) and private members use a "-" symbol.

Static members are shown with an \underline{underlined} name, while abstract members are shown in *italics*.

#### Interfaces

Sometimes there is a need to convey the concept of "interface" inside a UML class diagram, that can easily be done in 2 ways:

- By using the class construct, with the keyword (called "stereotype") `<<interface>>` written on top of it;
- By using the "lollipop notation" (also called "interface realisation").

![Defining an interface in UML](./images/computer_science/interface.svg){width=15%}

![Interface Realisation in UML](./images/computer_science/interface_realization.svg){width=15%}

#### Relationships between entities of the class diagram

Expressing only single classes on their own doesn't give UML a lot of expressive power when it comes to planning your games. Here we'll take a quick look at the most used relationships between classes.

![Relationships between classes in an UML Diagram](./images/computer_science/class_relationships.svg){width=60%}

##### Inheritance

Inheritance is represented via a hollow closed arrow head that points towards the base class (exactly like in [Actor inheritance](#UMLUserCaseActors)), this means that the classes are in a "super-type and sub-type" relationship.

![Example of inheritance in UML class diagrams](./images/computer_science/class_inheritance.svg){width=15%}

In this example we say that "Student IS-A Person" and inherits all Person's methods and fields.

##### Interface realisation

Interface realisation can be complex to understand at first, given its formal definition:

> The interface realisation relationship specifies that the realising class must conform to the contract that the provided interface specifies.

In short, it means that the class is implementing all the methods specified by the interface (thus "realising" it, as in making it real).

![Example of interface realisation in UML class diagram](./images/computer_science/class_interface_realization.svg){width=30%}

##### Association

Association represents a static relationship between two classes. This is usually represented with a solid line with an arrow. The arrow usually shows the reading order of the association, so if you see an "Author" class and a "Book" class, the "wrote" association will be pointing from the "Author" to the "Book" class.

In case the relationship is bi-directional, the arrow points are omitted, leaving only a solid line between the two classes.

![Example of association in UML class diagrams](./images/computer_science/class_association.svg){width=15%}

An example of an association is the relationship between a "Person" and a "Magazine", such relationship is the "Subscription". In this case the relationship is bi-directional, since a "Magazine" can be subscribed by many people, but a single "Person" can subscribe to many "Magazine"s.

##### Aggregation and Composition

Aggregation is a special case of the association relationship, and represents a more specific case of it. Aggregation is a variant of a "has-a" relationship and represents a part-whole relationship.

Aggregation is represented with a hollow diamond and a line that points to the *contained* class, classes involved in an aggregation relationships *do not* have their life cycles dependant one another, that means that if the container is destroyed, the contained objects will keep on living. An example could be a teacher and their students, if the teacher dies the students will keep on living.

![Example of aggregation and composition in UML class diagrams](./images/computer_science/class_aggregation_composition.svg){width=35%}

Composition is represented with a filled diamond instead than a hollow one, in this case there is a life cycle dependency, so when the container is destroyed the contents are destroyed too. Like when a university is dissolved, its departments will cease to exist.

##### Dependency

The dependency relationship is the one that gives us the least amount of coupling, it represents a "supplier-client" relationships, where the supplier supplies its functions (methods) to the client. The association is represented in a dashed line with an open arrow that points towards the supplier.

This means that the client class requires, needs or depends on the supplier.

There are many categories of dependency, like `<<create>` or `<<call>>` that explain further the type of dependency exists between the supplier and the client.

An example could be between a "Car Factory" and a class "Car": the "CarFactory" class depends on the "Car" class, and such dependency is an instantiation dependency.

![Example of dependency in UML class diagrams](./images/computer_science/class_dependency.svg){width=15%}

#### Notes

As with Use Case diagrams, class diagrams can make use of notes too, and the graphical language used to represent them is exactly the same one used in the Use Case Diagrams.

### Activity Diagrams

Activity diagrams are the more powerful version of flow charts: they represent the flux of an activity in detail, allowing to have a better understanding of a process or algorithm.

![Example of an activity diagram](./images/computer_science/activity.svg){width=30%}

#### Start and End Nodes

Each diagram begins what a "start node", represented with a filled black circle, and they end with an "end node" which is represented with a filled black circle inside of a hollow circle.

![Example of activity diagrams start and end nodes](./images/computer_science/activity_start_end.svg){width=20%}

#### Actions

Each action taken by the software is represented in the diagram via a rounded rectangle, a very short description of the action is written inside the rounded rectangle space.

![Example of Action in activity diagrams](./images/computer_science/activity_action.svg){width=30%}

#### Decisions (Conditionals) and loops

Decisions and loops are enclosed in diamonds. If a condition needs to be written, the diamond can become an hexagon, to make space for the condition to be written or guards can be used to express the condition.

![Example of decision, using hexagons to represent the condition](./images/computer_science/activity_decision_hex.svg){width=40%}

![Example of loops, using guards to represent the condition](./images/computer_science/activity_loop_guards.svg){width=40%}

All the branches that depend on a condition or are part of a loop start and end on a diamond, as shown below.

![Example of how nested loops and conditions are performed](./images/computer_science/nested_activity.svg){width=40%}

#### Synchronisation

Synchronisation (or parallel processing) is represented in activity diagrams by using filled black bars that enclose the concurrent processes: the bars are called "synchronisation points" or "forks" and "joins"

![Example of concurrent processes in activity diagrams](./images/computer_science/activity_concurrent.svg){width=30%}

In the previous example, the activities "Send Order Confirmation" and "Process Order" are processed in parallel, independently from each other, the first activity that finishes will wait until the other activity finishes before entering the end node.

#### Signals

Signals are used to represent how activities can be influenced or modified from outside the system. There are two symbols used to represent signals.

The "Sent Signal" symbol is represented with a convex pentagon (which reminds an arrow going away from our system), while the "Received Signal" is represented by a concave pentagon (which reminds a "slot" where the "sent signal" symbol can connect to).

![Example of signals in activity diagrams](./images/computer_science/activity_signals.svg){width=30%}

#### Swimlanes

Swimlanes are a way to organise and group related activities in columns. For instance a shopping activity diagram can have the "Customer", "Order", "Accounting" and "Shipping" swimlanes, each of which contains activities related to their own categories.

![Example of swimlanes in activity diagrams](./images/computer_science/activity_swimlanes.svg){width=50%}

#### Notes

As with Use Case and Class diagrams, Activity Diagrams can make use of notes, in the same way as the other two diagrams we presented in this book do.

![Example of a note inside of an activity diagram](./images/computer_science/activity_notes.svg){width=50%}

#### A note on activity diagrams

The components of activity diagrams shown here are just a small part of the used components, but they should be enough to get you started designing and reading most of the activity diagrams that exist.

### Sequence Diagrams

Sequence diagrams are used to represents how objects (called "participants") interact with each other and such interactions are represented in a time sequence.

#### Lifelines

The central concept of sequence diagrams are lifelines: the represent the time a participant is "alive" and when it is doing something.

![Example of a sequence diagram lifeline](./images/computer_science/sequence_lifeline.svg){width=30%}

The time flows from top to bottom, a dashed line represents the participant exists (for instance an object is instantiated in memory), while the rectangle that replaces the dotted line represents the participant being "active" (for instance one of the object's functions is called).

##### Participants

The participants don't have to be actual classes, since sequence diagrams represent interactions at a "higher level" than mere code-bound planning.

Some UML drawing software allows for custom shapes for each participant, like the following:

![Some alternative shapes for participants](./images/computer_science/sequence_participants.svg){width=50%}

#### Messages

Each object (represented by a lifeline) communicates with other objects (and the "outside") through "messages".

Messages are represented by arrows and an example can be seen here:

![Messages in a sequence diagram](./images/computer_science/sequence_messages.svg){width=50%}

Let's analyse them one by one:

- **Found Messages** are messages that come from "outside", from the perspective of the part of the system we are analysing, they may come from another system or even the user.
- **Synchronous Messages and returns** are messages that activate a class and wait for a "return message". These usually represent a synchronous function call (but it can represent a more abstract concept).
- **Asynchronous Messages** are messages that activate a class but don't wait for a return value. These usually represent asynchronous functions calls.
- **Self-messages** are messages from an object to itself, they usually represent an internal function call.
- **Lost Messages** are messages sent towards the "outside", from the perspective of the part of the system we are analysing.

#### Object Instantiation and Destruction

Sometimes it may be useful to represent the instantiation and destruction of objects in a sequence diagram. UML provides such facilities via the `<<instantiate>>`, `<<create>>` and `<<destroy>>` keywords, as well as a symbol for the destruction of an object.

![Object instantiation and destruction in a sequence diagram](./images/computer_science/sequence_instantiation_destruction.svg){width=40%}

#### Grouping and loops

From time to time, we may need to represent a series of messages being sent in parallel, a loop, or just group some messages to represent them in a clearer manner. This is where grouping comes of use: it has a representation based on "boxes", like the following:

![A loop grouping in a sequence diagram](./images/computer_science/sequence_grouping.svg){width=40%}

#### Notes

Like all UML diagrams, it is possible to use notes to add some comments that may be useful for the interpretation of our diagrams, like follows.

![Example of notes in a sequence diagram](./images/computer_science/sequence_notes.svg){width=40%}

### Other diagrams

UML is composed by a ton of diagrams that can be used to communicate with your teammates and organise your work, among them we find:

- Component Diagrams;
- Communication Diagrams;
- Composite Structure Diagrams;
- Deployment Diagrams;
- Package Diagrams;
- Profile Diagrams;
- State Diagrams;
- Timing Diagrams.

I this chapter we just saw the ones that will help you the most when reading the rest of this book, as well as effectively planning any project you have in mind.
