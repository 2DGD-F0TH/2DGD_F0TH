### Scrolling Backgrounds and Parallax Scrolling

When doing any kind of game that features a scrolling background, you should construct your art accordingly, allowing for enough variety to make the game interesting while avoiding creating huge artwork that weighs on the game's performance.

In a game that uses a scrolling background, the background used should be at least two times the screen size, in the scrolling direction ([Virtual Resolution] can prove really useful in this case) and the image should have what are called "loop points".

Loop points are points where the image repeats itself, thus allowing us to create an image that is virtually infinite, scrolling through the screen.

The image below shows a background and its loop points.

To make an image appear like it's scrolling infinitely we need to move it back and forth between loop points when the screen passes over them.

For ease of explanation let's consider a screen scrolls towards the right, when we have reached a loop point, we reset the image position back to the position it was at the beginning and, since the image has been crafted to loop, the player won't notice that the background has been reset.

Match-x Games
--------------

### Managing and drawing the grid

When it comes to a match-x game, a good data structure for the play field is a matrix.

In most programming languages, a matrix is saved as an "array of arrays", where you have each element of an array representing a row, and each element of a row is a tile.

![Example of a matrix, saved as "array of arrays"](./images/specific_genre/array_arrays.pdf){width=60%}

This is a really nice way to interpret a grid, but at the same time it can open the door to some pitfalls if you're not careful.

Many programming languages allow for direct access to an element inside an "array of arrays" by using multiple access operators (usually the `[]` operator) in a row.

Usually each element you access with the first `[]` operator represents the rows, while the second time you use `[]` you will access the columns, this will make it so you need to access an element directly as follows: `matrix[y][x]` where "y" is the row number and "x" is the column number, which can prove counter-intuitive.

In the previous example, if we want to access the highlighted item, at the third row (indexed at 2), and in the fifth column (indexed at 4). We have to use `matrix[2][4]`, which is the opposite of what many people are used to when they think in `(x,y)` coordinates.

Try to keep visual representation and data structures separated in your mind, to avoid confusion.

### Finding and removing Matches

If you're doing a simple match-x game where you can only match tiles horizontally or vertically, the algorithm to find matches is quite simple, both conceptually and computationally.

The main idea is dividing the "horizontal matches" from the "vertical" ones. This will allow to simplify the algorithm and avoid some pitfalls (unless you want to give bonuses for "T-shaped" and "L shaped" matches).

For horizontal matches the idea is running through each row, keeping some variables representing the length of the match, as well as the color of the current "ongoing" match. As soon as we find a different color, if the length of the "ongoing" match is higher than "x" (usually 3), we save the references to the tiles involved for later removal.

Similarly we can do the same algorithm for vertical matches, by running through each column and saving the matches.

Here is a pseudo-code example:

\code{specific_genre/match3_findhorizontalmatches}

Let's talk a second about the last rows in the algorithm: they are specifically tailored to address a corner case that happens when there is a match that ends on the right border of the screen.

If such code was not there, the match number would grow by one, then the for loop would reset everything and we'd lose such match.

Similarly, we can make an algorithm that allows for vertical matches to be memorized for later removal:

\code{specific_genre/match3_findverticalmatches}

Both algorithms run in $O(n)$, where "n" is the number of tiles on the screen.

Now we can proceed to remove every tile that has been memorized as "part of a match", the quickest way may be to set such tile to "null" (or an equivalent value for your programming language).

#### Why don't we delete the matches immediately?

We could, but that would open the door to a pitfall that could be tough to manage: in case of a "T" match, we would find that the "horizontal matches" algorithm deletes part of said match, and the "vertical matches" algorithm wouldn't be able to complete the "T match", because the necessary tiles are deleted.

Let's see the image to understand better:

![What happens when deleting a match immediately](./images/specific_genre/immediate_deletion.pdf){width=60%}

As visible from the first image, there is a T-shaped match involving cells 0,1,2 of row 0, cell 1 of row 1 and cell 1 of row 2.

If we deleted the horizontal match immediately, we would lose the possibility of completing the vertical match (highlighted in the second image).

Instead we memorize everything first, and then delete all the matches at once, without the risk of losing anything.
