Character Design
----------------

Characters, both playable and not, are one of the pillars onto which games build on. If the characters are shallow, uninteresting or don't fit, the player will have one less reason to stick with playing your game until the end.

Here are some tips to make your characters more interesting and add more depth to the world you are building.

### Make your characters suck at something

Perfect is boring.

One of the best ways you can make your characters interesting is by making them really bad at something. It can be a valiant knight, renowned for his strength and valor, but for some reason he's rough and rude, for instance.

Another idea could be having a warrior that is the strongest the world has ever seen, but they're brash, arrogant and absolutely unreasonable in their actions, to the point where the player may even question their sanity.

Having "defects" makes the character more relatable and realistic, or at least gives more depth to them. Plus when a character has shortcomings, you can leverage that for comedic effect.
