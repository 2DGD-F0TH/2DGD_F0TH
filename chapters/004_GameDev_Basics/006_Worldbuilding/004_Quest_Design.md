Quest design
------------

After you create your world, you need to give the player something to do in such world. That's where your quest design capabilities will shine.

In this section you will find some tips and tricks to make quests more fun, meaningful and enjoyable.

### You can make "busy work" interesting too

Nobody likes fetch quests. Or at least, "fetch quests for the sake of fetching something" are boring.

You can put a twist on the so-called "fetch quests" by adding a story layer on them: why does the quest giver want the item you're looking for? What if, after finding the item, you started being attacked by a certain group of people, seeking to steal the item from you?

One way of making fetch quests more interesting is using them to introduce a bigger story: fetching an item, being attacked by a certain group (like a secret organization) and having the item stolen from you, tracking down the group and uncover a secret plot to topple the king.

The only limit is your fantasy.
