World Building
==============

:::::: {.epigraph author="J.R.R. Tolkien"}
Nobody believes me when I say that my long book is an attempt to create a world in which a form of language agreeable to my personal aesthetic might seem real. But it is true.

Good part of game design consists in creating a world that is coherent and makes sense in the players' minds.

If a world doesn't abide by its own rules well enough, the so-called "suspension of disbelief" is interrupted and the player will begin to think with the logic of the real world and will be pulled out of the world you have created.

This may create different kinds of issues and confusion or boredom or even have the player begin to engage in so-called ["meta-gaming~\[g\]~"](#gl_metagaming), where the player begins using real-world knowledge to step around the game's rules.
