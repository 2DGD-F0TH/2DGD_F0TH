Level Design
------------

After writing your characters, they need a place to live in. Their world is composed of smaller sections (which are called "maps" or "levels"), that's where level design comes in.

Anything that touches the level itself, from the simple visual aspect to the history of the world that a level is part of, is part of the bigger class of "level design" and in this section, we'll check out some small tips to make your world better.

### Anything can tell a story

Any object can tell its own small piece of story about the world you're building.

What's the reason behind a small fetch quest that you've been tasked to complete? Maybe that apple that you were tasked to retrieve is a very rare item that can cure a rare disease, or a rusty sword you found in a dungeon might have been owned by the most renowned king in the past.

Even something as simple as a somewhat detailed description of the item may give it more depth. Here's a small example:

> Seeds of the Lifeblood Tree: A small seedling coming from a shrub that used to be cultivated centuries ago. Its thick, blood-colored sap is said to be the blood of the Earth God, able to cure wounds and poisoning alike.
> Due to the 3rd Pontian-Saarland war, the scorches caused by the battles destroyed all known places where this shrub could be found. This seed pod seems to have survived the fires and may still sprout.

:::: trivia ::::
The "Dark Souls" series brings this concept to the extreme: there is no narration and almost the entirety of the story is told through the description of the objects you find along the way. It is your task to piece everything together and discover what the lore is.

### Details matter

Details can, in some cases, matter as much as the bigger picture: a small animation of grass rustling in the wind or moving when characters cross it can make the world feel a lot more cohesive and cared for.

Some people may gloss over such details, but others may really appreciate the added care and thought that went onto creating your world.

Some details that you can include may be:

- Trees rustling in breezy or windy areas;
- Leaves falling in autumn (you can use [Particle systems for that](#particle_systems));
- Grass rustling when an entity crosses it (or when a smaller entity hides in it);
- "Dangling Physics": anything that can reproduce the behaviour of a dangling object when touched by someone;
- "Breakable Objects": an object that can fall and shatter if bumped, or something that explodes if shot (even just a bottle);
- Soundscapes, like having reverb in very big empty spaces, making metal bunkers sound tinny and dry ...;
- Much, much more.
