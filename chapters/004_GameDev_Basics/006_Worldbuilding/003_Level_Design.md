Level Design
------------

After writing your characters, they need a place to live in. Their world is composed of smaller sections (which are called "maps" or "levels"), that's where level design comes in.

Anything that touches the level itself, from the simple visual aspect to the history of the world that a level is part of, is part of the bigger class of "level design" and in this section, we'll check out some small tips to make your world better.

### Anything can tell a story

Any object can tell its own small piece of story about the world you're building.

What's the reason behind a small fetch quest that you've been tasked to complete? Maybe that apple that you were tasked to retrieve is a very rare item that can cure a rare disease, or a rusty sword you found in a dungeon might have been owned by the most renowned king in the past.

Even something as simple as a somewhat detailed description of the item may give it more depth. Here's a small example:

> Seeds of the Lifeblood Tree
> A small seedling coming from a shrub that used to be cultivated centuries ago. Its thick, blood-colored sap is said to be the blood of the Earth God, able to cure wounds and poisoning alike.
> Due to the 3rd Pontian-Saarland war, the scorches caused by the battles destroyed all known places where this shrub could be found. This seed pod seems to have survived the fires and may still sprout.

:::: trivia ::::
The "Dark Souls" series brings this concept to the extreme: there is no narration and almost the entirety of the story is told through the description of the objects you find along the way. It is your task to piece everything together and discover what the lore is.
