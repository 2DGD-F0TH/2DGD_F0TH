Story Design
------------

Some (not all!) games have a story. Guiding your player through it might seem a bit daunting, but there are some tips you can follow to make your life a bit easier.

### Use the "illusion of choice" to gently push the story forward

The simple sequence of "this event" then "that event" and then "that other event" can get really old, really quickly.

This is where the "illusion of choice" comes in and may help you making your story a bit more interesting while keeping it somewhat linear.

Let's imagine a story where your character must be brought to the police station to further the story: it's a good idea to have the police question the character in front of their home first to set the scene.

You can have the character do various things that lead them to the same ending:

- Tell the truth, but such truth is not believable (or the police is misguided). The police doesn't believe the player and brings them in for questioning.
- Admit involvement, but deny any responsibility. The police will take the player's involvement at face value and brings them in for further questioning.
- Make up a lie. The police notices inconsistencies in the player's responses and brings them in for questioning.

As you can see, we have given the player three different options that lead to the same outcome (eventually through different dialogue).
