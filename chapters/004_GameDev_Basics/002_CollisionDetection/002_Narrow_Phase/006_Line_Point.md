### Line/Point Collision

We can represent a segment by using its two extreme points, which proves to be a quite inexpensive way to represent a line (it's just two points). Now how do we know if a point is colliding with a line?

To know if a point is colliding with a line we need... Triangles!

Every triangle can be represented with 3 points, and there is a really useful theorem that we can make use of:

> The sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than, or equal, to the length of the remaining side.

So, given a triangle ABC:

![Example of the triangle inequality theorem](./images/collision_detection/triangle_ineq1.svg){width=30%}

We get the following 3 inequalities:

$$ \overline{AB} + \overline{BC} \leq \overline{AC} $$
$$ \overline{AC} + \overline{BC} \leq \overline{AB} $$
$$ \overline{AB} + \overline{AC} \leq \overline{BC} $$

What is more interesting to us is that when the one of the vertices of the triangle is **on** its opposite side, the triangle degenerates:

![Example of a degenerate triangle](./images/collision_detection/triangle_ineq2.svg){width=30%}

And the theorem degenerates too, to the following:

$$ \overline{AC} + \overline{BC} = \overline{AB}$$

So we can calculate the distance between the point and each of the two extremes of the line and we know that when the sum of such distances is equal to the length of the line, the point will be colliding with the line.

In code, it would look something like the following:

```{src='collisiondetection/line_point' caption='Line to Point Collision detection'}
```

It could prove useful to put a "buffer zone" in here too, so that the collision detection doesn't result too jerky and precise. In that case you may want to take a look at the [line vs circle](#line_circle) algorithm, in that case the radius would be the "approximation" of the point.
