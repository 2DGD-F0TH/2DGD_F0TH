### Collision Between Two Axis-Aligned Rectangles (AABB) {#AABB}

This is one of the most used types of collision detection used in games: it's a bit more involved than other types of collision detection, but it's still computationally easy to perform. This is usually called the "Axis Aligned Bounding Box" collision detection, or AABB.

Let's start with a bit of theory. We have two squares:

![Example used in the AABB collision detection](./images/collision_detection/AABB1.svg){width=30%}

To know if we may have a collision, we need to check if one of the sides is "inside" (that means between the top and bottom sides) of another rectangle:

![Top-Bottom Check](./images/collision_detection/AABB2.svg){width=30%}

In this case we know that the "top side" of the second rectangle (highlighted in blue) has a `y` coordinate between the first rectangle's top and bottom sides' `y` coordinates (highlighted in red).

Though this is a necessary condition, this is not sufficient, since we may have a situation where this condition is satisfied, but the rectangles don't collide:

![Top-Bottom Check is not enough](./images/collision_detection/AABB3.svg){width=30%}

So we need to check the other sides also, in a similar fashion:

![An example of a left-right check](./images/collision_detection/AABB4.svg){width=30%}

This has to happen for all four sides of one of the rectangle.

Now we can try putting down a bit of code, we'll assume that rectangles are defined by their top-left corner (as usually happens) and their width and height:

```{src='collisiondetection/AABB' caption='Axis-Aligned Bounding Box Collision Detection'}
```

This complex conditional checks 4 things:

- The left side of rectangle A is **at the left** of the right side of rectangle B;
- The right side of rectangle A is **at the right** of the left side of rectangle B;
- The top side of rectangle A is **over** the bottom side of rectangle B;
- The bottom side of rectangle A is **underneath** the top side of rectangle B.

If all four checks are true, then a collision happened.

The best way to understand this algorithm properly is to test it by hand and convince yourself that it works.

This is a very light algorithm but can quickly become heavy on the CPU when there are many objects to check for collision. We'll see later how to limit the number of checks and make collision detection an operation that is not as heavy on our precious CPU cycles.
