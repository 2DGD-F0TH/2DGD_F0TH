Tutorials

### Do not pad tutorials

Tutorials are meant to introduce the player to the game's mechanics, but a bad tutorial can ruin the experience. Tutorials should be comprehensive but also compact, padding tutorials should absolutely not be a thing.

Gloss over the simpler things (usually the ones that are common to the genre) and focus more on the unique mechanics of your game.

Avoid things like:

> Use the "right arrow" button to move right, the "left arrow" button to move left, use "up arrow" to jump, use "down arrow" to crouch

Instead use:

> Use the arrows to move.

And eventually present the more complex mechanics in an "obstacle course" fashion.

### Integrate tutorials in the lore

Tutorials are better when well-integrated in the lore, for instance if your game features a high-tech suit maybe you should make a "training course" inside the structure where such suit was invented.

By integrating the tutorial into the game world, it will feel less of a tutorial for the player, but more like training for the game's protagonist.

### Let the player explore the controls

Sometimes it's better to allow the player to explore the controls, by giving them a safe area to try: this area is usually a tutorial or a specific training area.

It can prove more effective to avoid spoon-feeding your player with all the moves, and just let them explore the core mechanics of the game by themselves, eventually assisted by an in-game manual of some sort.

So instead of doing something like (thinking about a 2D tournament fighter):

> Do $\rightarrow \searrow \downarrow$ + A to do a chop attack
>
> Do $\rightarrow \nearrow \uparrow$ + A to do an uppercut
>
> ...

Try something like:

> Do $\rightarrow \nearrow \uparrow$ + A to do an uppercut
>
> Try more combination with your arrows and the attack buttons for more moves
>
> Check the move list in the pause menu
