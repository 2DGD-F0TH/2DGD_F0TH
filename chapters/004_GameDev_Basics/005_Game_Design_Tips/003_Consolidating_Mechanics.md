Consolidating and refreshing the game mechanics
------------------------------------------------

### Remind the player about the mechanics they learned

There's a latin saying that goes "repetita juvant", which means "repeating does good".

A good idea is to sprinkle around different levels concepts that have been learned previously, so to remind and consolidate them. This is more effective when done shortly after learning a new mechanic.

### Introduce new ways to use old mechanics

After a while, old mechanics tend to become stale, to rejuvinate them we can apply such mechanics to new problems. Changing their use slightly can make an old experience new again.

For instance, knowing that shooting our magic beam against something on the ceiling will make it drop (usually killing an enemy), we can make the player use such envinronmental interactivity to drop a suspended weight to open a door, or shoot a bell to "force" a change of guard so to sneak stealthily.
