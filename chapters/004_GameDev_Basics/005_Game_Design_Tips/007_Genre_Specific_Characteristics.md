Some game genres and their characteristics
------------------------------------------

### Roguelikes and Rogue-lites

Roguelike games are usually games that involve dungeon-crawling and procedurally generated levels, usually with a fantasy background. In this small section we will take a look at the features that characterize roguelike games.

The most accepted interpretation of a roguelike game is the "Berlin Interpretation", which is based on the features that follow. When games diverge from these features, but are still loosely based on the classic roguelike design, they are usually called "rogue-lites" or "roguelike-likes".

#### Use of pseudo-randomness and procedural generation

This is done to increase replayability: the dungeons (or levels alike) are generated procedurally, with a tinge of randomness added to them. Joining procedural generation and pseudo-randomness is better than simple pseudo-randomness, since the rules applied will make the level beatable without special equipment, as well as lead to more aesthetically pleasing levels overall.

#### Permadeath

In the great majority of roguelike games, the death of a character is permanent. When a character dies, the player will have to begin a new "run": the levels will be generated anew and the available loot will change too.

Usually permadeath is joined with an erasure of the savefile connected to the "failed run", this avoids so-called "save-scumming": a practice where players would load back their savefile repeatedly to achieve better results (which is usually considered akin to cheating, in the roguelike field).

Another way to stop "save-scumming" is deleting the savefile when loading it, so when you save the only thing you can do to keep your savefile is exiting the game.

Permadeath makes the "save game" functionality more of a "suspension of the gameplay" instead of giving the player a recoverable state they can limitlessly return to.

#### Turn-based Gameplay

Like tabletop games, the gameplay of roguelikes is usually turn-based: this allows the player to take as much time as needed to take a decision.

#### Lack of mode-based gameplay

Roguelikes don't have a real concept of "progression": they allow you to do anything from the get-go, without blocking any action just because you're at a certain point in the game.

#### Multiple ways to accomplish (or fail!) a task

Roguelikes usually allow you to complete a task in many different ways, so many in fact that it seems the developers thought of everything. Let's take for example a locked door, a roguelike game would give you many options:

- Find the key or trigger to open such door;
- Lockpick it;
- Burn it down;
- Find a way around it;
- Kick it down;
- ...

This also means that you have to be careful with your actions: if a weapon freezes entities when it touches their flesh, you better have a pair of gloves handy (or you may end up frozen yourself!).

#### Resource Management is key

Resource Management in roguelike games is vital: usually they feature a hunger mechanic, as well as healing items, weapons and various loot that the player must sort through to be able to survive. The player will be forced to leave some loot on the floor of the dungeon, or choose between a known weapon and something unknown that may be weaker or "cursed".

#### Peace was never an option

Most roguelike games are based on hack and slash mechanics, where your main goal is killing monsters. In this kind of games, "peaceful options" don't exist (although they may exist, in a somewhat temporary fashion, to put leverage on some stealth mechanics - like getting a better weapon to kill a powerful enemy by first sneaking around them).

#### Dealing with the unknown

Roguelike games are heavily based on the concept of "unknown": you need to explore an unknown place, finding loot which powers are unknown and should be identified. Magical items change with every run, and give just vague descriptions (like "a red potion") which may heal in one run and kill you in another.

Furthermore items can be subject to change, acquiring or losing traits due to environmental alterations or player modification.
