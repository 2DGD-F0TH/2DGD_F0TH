Rewarding the player
---------------------

### Reward the player for their "lateral thinking"

A good idea could be rewarding the player for not throwing themselves "head first" into the fight, but instead thinking out of the box and avoid the fight altogether, or just win it differently.

Putting a very powerful enemy in front of some treasure (for instance currency used in-game) can seem unfair, unless you place an unstable stalactite that can be shot with your magic beam.

Your magic beam won't deal enough damage to the enemy to kill it before such enemy takes your life, but a stalactite on their head will do the trick, and the reward for such lateral thinking will be a heap of coins (or gems, or whatever currency you invented).

Giving tips to the player by breaking the fourth wall can be another idea, a rock or a patch of dead grass conveniently shaped like an arrow could point towards a secret room that has a fake wall.

This last tip should be done very subtly, so not to ruin the immersion. Unless your game takes advantage from these kind of things (for instance games based on comedy).

### Reward the player for their tenacity

After suggesting to reward players for not butting head-first into fights, now I'm going to suggest the exact opposite (in a way): reward your players for their tenacity.

Beating a tough boss with a certain (weak) weapon, or just the plain tenacity and skill that is needed to undertake a hard task, such feats should be rewarded: for instance with a powerful weapon that can be used after some level-ups.

### Reward the player for exploring

Exploration can lead the player to discover secrets, which can range from simple gear, to pieces of unexplored environment, or even pieces of the game's lore.

World exploration should not be limited to simple secrets, a nice idea could be finding a path towards something that is usually considered "environmental damage" (like a catapult in the background) so that the player can deactivate it.

Thinking out of the box can lead to some really interesting results when it comes to this tip.

### Reward the player for not immediately following the given direction

This is an extension of the previous point, the player should be rewarded for their exploratory efforts, even more when those efforts mean not immediately following the direction given by the designer.

"Thinking differently" should be rewarded with challenge and rewards up to said challenge. If the mission tells a player to climb up a tower, the more curious players could be led to hit the tower's underground dungeon before going on with the mission. A nice challenge in such dungeon with a fittin reward could expand on the game experience.

### Reward the player for not trusting you entirely

Sometimes it can be fun, for both the game designer and the player, to play a bit of a trick to the player themselves.

Some famous games, like DOOM and Dark Souls, use secrets-in-secrets to trick players into thinking they found something valuable, while hiding something way more important. Let's see the example below.

![Example of secret-in-secret](./images/game_design/secret_in_secret.png){width=50%}

We can see how we hid a secret inside of another secret and used a piece of valuable (but not *too valuable*) treasure to make the player think they found the secret, while the real secret is hiding behind another fake wall.

### Reward Backtracking (but don't make it mandatory!)

To make the game's experience broader and richer, you may want to reward the player's exploration efforts by hiding treasure behind some backtracking.

For instance you can show the player a locked door somewhere in the level, such door will unlock and open after beating a boss monster or a wave-based challenge in the next room and hide some weapons that would otherwise be unlocked further into the game.

A nice idea would be "suggesting" to the player that something interesting happened, by playing the sound of the door opening as soon as the event is triggered. Another idea would be showing the player that the door opened (for instance if you're in an open area, the player would be able to see clearly an open gate that was definitely closed before).

The most important thing to remember is that all of this needs to be optional, a reward for the player's willingness to explore your levels further: avoid making backtracking mandatory, this will only feel like you're "padding the game" with nothing worth of note.

The player is paying you with their time and effort, it's only right that you pay them back with a pleasurable experience.

::: trivia :::
A nice example of backtracking bonuses (although mandatory to 100% the game) is used in the level "Sphynxinator" in Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped.

When you start the level, you can run backwards and you'll find 4 crates (which are necessary to get the "Gem" and 100% the game, but not mandatory for the normal ending), one of which is an extra life.

The backtracking is really short and gives you a nice bonus.

### The "lives" system

Extra ships, 1-ups, extends, continues: these are all instances of what we can call the "lives system". This system gives a more "arcade feel" to your game and adds an important challenge factor to it.

Without something that threatens a game over, beating the game is no longer a challenge, but it's a matter of time. When overcoming a challenge is inevitable, it is not a challenge anymore, and the player will end up losing interest.

This is what the "lives system" is for: it's a "sword of Damocles", hanging over the player's head, continuously threatening a "game over" and pushing the player to do their best in order to get as far into the game as possible.

"Continues" are just "a lives system for your lives", they're in a very limited number (or have a price, like putting another quarter into the arcade cabinet) and allow you to "continue the game" with a new set of "lives" without losing your progress.

As with all things in video games, it doesn't need to bring real challenge, but just the "illusion" of it.

Furthermore, lives and continues are a great tool to reward your player for their efforts: giving them an extra life every 20.000 points, granting a continue for a no-hit boss battle, putting a bunch of 1-ups in a hard-to-reach place are all great ways to challenge and reward your player and give your game more depth.

#### 1-UPs

When a life system is in place, getting an extra life (a so-called 1-UP) is cause for celebration, since it allows the player to get further into the game or play with new and bolder strategies or just feel more at ease.

There are many ways you can reward the player with an extra life, such as:

- Finding a secret;
- Reaching a certain score threshold (for example every 100.000 points);
- Finding a certain item (a "physical 1-UP");
- Complete a certain combo-chain (for example kill over 8 enemies without touching the ground);
- ...

No matter how the 1-UP is achieved, this should be celebrated with a jingle that is very recognizable: this will allow the player to "know" that they got a 1-UP without thinking too hard about it. Not "celebrating" this event would make it "ordinary" and uninteresting, while it's extremely important in the grand scheme of things.

Some games even go as far as temporarily pause the game while the (short) jingle plays, that how important an extra-life is: "Stop everything! We got a 1-UP here!".

#### Other approaches

There are different approaches to a "lives system" that don't necessarily involve lives. The main objective is creating a mechanic that rewards the player for doing the right thing and punish them for doing the wrong thing (although not too harshly, or the player will stop playing).

One such approach was used in the first System Shock (1994) game: the space station the game takes place in is divided into floors. Each floor (with few exceptions) have a "cyborg conversion chamber": if you die your body will be brought to a conversion chamber in the floor you're in and will become a cyborg, serving the enemy. Being converted into a cyborg is the losing condition, and the punishment is being sent to the main menu and being forced to load a save file.

Here's the catch: the "cyborg conversion chambers" are fashioned out of "restoration bays", that means that disabling the cyborg conversion process will allow the player to be immediately resurrected at the nearest restoration bay, although they won't start at full health. This rewards the player for finding such restoration bays by giving them essentially infinite lives.
