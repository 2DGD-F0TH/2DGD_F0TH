Dissecting games: two study cases
=================================

In this section we will talk about two games, one bad and one good, and study their decisions closely, how a bad game inconveniences the player or how a good one reduces the space between the player's thought and the action on the screen.

This is not intended as a section to diss on a bad game or sing the praises of a good one, it is meant to be a study on how bad decisions pile up into what is universally recognized as a "bad game", while there are so many good decisions that need to be taken to make a "good game".

A bad game: Hoshi wo miru hito
-------------------------------

### Introduction

"Hoshi wo miru hito" is a Japanese turn-based RPG for the NES, set in a future where everyone has "Extra Sensory Perception" (ESP) and where a supercomputer has enslaved humanity via brainwashing.

The story may sound thrilling but the game is not. Let's see why this game is also known as "Densetsu no Kusoge" (I will leave finding the meaning to the reader).

### Balance Issues

#### You can't beat starter enemies

\placeholder

#### The Damage Sponge

\placeholder

#### Can't run away from battles, but enemies can

\placeholder

<!--
You can't beat starting enemies
"Barrier Maiden" Misa is the only character that can cross damage tiles without taking damage
You cannot run away from battles, until you get the teleport spell, which works better when failing
-->

#### Statistics

<!--
The defense stat scales so badly it's unnoticeable
The speed stat is unused (every battle goes your team - their team, regardless of speed)
-->

### Bad design choices

#### You get dropped in the middle of nowhere

<!--
You get dropped in the middle of nowhere, it's all in the manual
-->

\placeholder

#### The starting town is invisible

<!--
The starting town is INVISIBLE and there is a lousy in-game excuse for it
-->

\placeholder

#### Jump Ability

<!--
At level 1 you can "jump rivers" but you don't know which rivers you can jump
-->

\placeholder

#### Items are invisible

<!--
All items in the overworld (including plot-crucial ones) are invisible and only a "ding" tells you picked up something
-->

\placeholder

#### Item management

<!--
If you buy a new weapon, the old one gets automatically discarded
you can't un-equip items
-->

\placeholder

#### Buying Weapons makes you weaker

<!--
Buying weapons makes you weaker: the ray gun does less damage cause the defense values of enemies come into play
-->

\placeholder

#### Enemy Abilities

<!--
Kariou Ability for enemies (Paralysis + Poison un-curable in battle)
When all party members are paralyzed you don't game over, you have to wait to be killed
-->

\placeholder

#### You can soft lock yourself

<!--
Keycards disappear on use, so you can get softlocked if you don't buy enough
-->

\placeholder

### Confusing Choices

#### Starting level for characters

<!--
You start at level 0
-->
\placeholder

#### Slow overworld movement

<!--
Very slow movement in the overworld, when the NES can manage faster movement
-->
\placeholder

#### Exiting a dungeon or a town

<!--
Exiting a dungeon or a town gets you at the beginning of the map
-->
\placeholder

#### The Health Points UI

<!--
Since you can get 5 digits of health, but they wouldn't fit, the last digit is always cropped from your HP
-->
\placeholder

### Inconveniencing the player

#### The battle menu order

<!--
The first option is "ESP" instead of "Fight"
-->
\placeholder

#### Every menu is a committal

<!--
No "back button" on menus, every menu is a committal, if you don't have enough mana for an ESP, you lose a turn
-->
\placeholder

#### Password saves
<!--
Password saves + passwords get you back at the lower multiple of level 4 and money at a multiple of 255
-->
\placeholder

#### Each player has their own money stash

\placeholder

### Bugs and glitches

#### Moonwalking and save warping

\placeholder

#### The final maze

\placeholder

<!-- In the last maze, first floor, no walls or encounter tiles have been programmed, in the other floors, no walls were programmed -->

#### The endings

<!--
The endings (join, leave or fight: but the latter makes you lose automatically)
-->
\placeholder


### Conclusions

<!-- Product of a rushed release to go against Dragon Quest, seems to be made by only one programmer, now has a cult following -->
