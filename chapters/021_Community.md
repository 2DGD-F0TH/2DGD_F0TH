Modding
-------

A great way to gather some more tech-savvy fans of your game is opening your game's structure to editing, which means enabling people to "mod" your game.

Mods are a great way to engage your community, either via new maps, upgraded textures or even total conversions!

Refining and giving out your own map editor can be a really great way to make your game more "open to editing" and allow modders to enjoy working on it, after that, if your game structure allows it, you could document the engine and allow people to create their own masterpieces, maps and fan-made stories.

Fan games
---------

If your game becomes so famous that you manage to get a full franchise out of it, fan games are bound to happen: small games that take inspiration from your storyline and take different directions, according to the creators' will. This is a great opportunity to test how your current game is liked, and how people would like for its story to develop.

Some developers prefer to squash fan games under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and get them removed, to avoid "tarnishing the franchise", some others instead prefer turning a blind eye, and some even go to hire the fan game creators to make a fully fledged official game.

In my humble opinion, fan games are good, they signal the community's desire for more, and you should probably play them too, new ideas come from comparing your own thoughts with other peoples'.

Speedrunning
------------

When your game has a decent success (or even if it doesn't!), there may be someone who wishes to challenge themselves into completing it as fast as they possibly can, sometimes with the aid of glitches.

The speedrunning community can really change your game from "obscure" to "well known", showing it at events and gatherings, making a fun show out of it, for better or for worse (hey, not all donuts come with a hole!): even when your game is "not so good" it can still be a fun oddity that people may want to speedrun.

Giving your own game a "speedrun mode" can prove beneficial, lowering the entrance bar to speedrunners and letting them know that you are thinking about them and would like them to speedrun your game.

What could such "speedrun mode" contain? More features than you may think about:

- **A game-wide chronometer:** this will allow to register how long beating the game takes;
- **A time for each section:** with the difference with older recorded times for each single level or section of the game;
- **Automatic Cutscene Skip:** cutscenes are usually just a waste of time in speedrunning, some may appreciate the fact that in this mode cutscenes don't play;
- **Automatic chronometer stop:** the chronometer can automatically stop at the end of the game, and the game itself can identify when a section is finished, giving a consistent way of evaluating speedruns.

Some game developers went to the extent of not fixing some glitches for the sake of speedrunning.

Randomizing
