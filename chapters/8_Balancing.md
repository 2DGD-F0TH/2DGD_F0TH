===================

The "No BS" principle
----------------------

<!-- TODO: talk about the "no bs" principle and list what breaks such principle -->

Cheating
---------

### Single Player

<!-- TODO: Not much damage, but could ruin the experience, talk about "assertions" and how it is possible to detect possible cheats -->

### P2P

<!-- TODO: Talk about the difficulties in detecting cheating when there is no "authoritative server", bringing to some normally useless implementations of an anti-cheat system -->

### Dedicated Servers

<!--TODO: Talk how having a dedicated server can bring an "authoritative game state" in the game, without risking that someone on either side is cheating -->
