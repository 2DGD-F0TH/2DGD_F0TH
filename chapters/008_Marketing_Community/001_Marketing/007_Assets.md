Assets and asset Flips
----------------------

Pre-made assets are both a resource and a liability when it comes to video game development, depending on how they are used.

Assets can be purchased by developers in a so-called "asset store" **as a basis**, a foundation upon which they can build their own game, that's how they are intended to be used and how they should indeed be used.

Sadly for every good thing, there must be a bad thing too: **asset flippers**.

Like "flipping a house" (minus the work), a group of assets can be put together (a bit like building blocks) into a somewhat working final product without much (or any) work, making a so-called **asset flip**.

These products are usually sold to adventurous or unknowing consumers for a quick buck or people who hope to make some money out of "out-of-game economies" (like Steam Cards or Tradeable Items), while the quality of the final product is lacking at best or terrible at worst.

This circles back to "being consumer-friendly": you're not selling to a single person, but to a lot of people with different backgrounds and expertise, and one of those **will** find out if your game is an "asset flip".

Flipping assets is the equivalent of betraying your customers, as well as living entirely on the work of who made said assets.

In short: assets are a good basis to work on your game (or make placeholders), but they need to be refined to elevate the quality of your game.
