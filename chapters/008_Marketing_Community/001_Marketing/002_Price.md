Pricing
--------

If you want to sell your game, *Pricing* is one of the 4 "P"s of marketing you should pay attention to (along with "Place", "Product" and "Promotion"), here you will find some tips on how to price your game.

### Penetrating the market with a low price

The video games market is quite large but also quite saturated, and it is really hard to stand out without a competitive visuals, mechanics and most of all: price.

Penetrating the market is easier when done with a low price, even more when your game does not boast "innovation" as one of its own strong points. Usually "retro" titles benefit from this pricing model.

After the initial "cheap" phase, you should be able to recover your investment by selling "premium" products later (like higher-budget games). The main objective of this strategy is to create the so-called "brand awareness", in short: letting yourself get known.

### Giving off a "premium" vibe with a higher price

When instead your game has something more (like cutting-edge, never seen before graphics capabilities), you may be able to keep a high price, giving off the vibe that your product is "superior" to its competition.

This can also work with products that offer really innovating concepts, and rarely works with "run of the mill" games that you see almost anywhere.

### The magic of "9"

There is something psychologically magic about the number 9. When you price something at \$0.99 instead of \$1.00, it looks like you're giving away the product for almost-free. Same goes for pricing your game \$39.99 instead of \$40.00, the price will look a lot closer to \$30.00 than \$40.00, even though the difference to \$40.00 is just 1 cent.

This effect is due to how our brains work: we're always trying to "be lazy", so our brain does a "first pass" which reads the price as being in the 60\$ range (for the reference image), and only then we realize it's actually much closer to 70. By that time, we already had a "first impression" of the price, which will be hard to remove.

### Launch Prices

Another way to create product awareness is setting a "launch price": a discounted price for the period the game is launching (for example a week), after that the game's price goes back to its "listing price".

This will ensure a quick influx of players (even more if you built hype well) that want to get your game for a bargain.

A variation could be having a low-priced base game, which then can be monetized with Downloadable Content (DLC) that add more to the base game.

### Bundling

Another way to entice players to buy your product is "bundling", that is "offering more for the same price". If your game has a really notable soundtrack, a good idea could be selling such soundtrack along with the game (which could help you pay your composers), or maybe a digital version of an artwork book, or sketches that can give an insight on the development.

Other types of bundling can include other games that you produced, or being part of a bundle of games of the same genre. An instance of "bundling" could be the famous "Humble Bundle", which bundles games around a certain theme or for a defined occasion (like Christmas Holidays).

It could be interesting to offer flexible prices on your bundles, like the following:

- Base Game: 9.99\$;
- Base Game + Soundtrack: 14.99\$;
- Base Game + Artwork Book: 15.99\$;
- Base Game + Soundtrack + Artwork Book: 18.99\$.

This will allow your players to choose which "extras" they want to buy, making them more comfortable in the process.

### Nothing beats the price of "Free" (Kinda)

Free to play games are all the rage these days, you can play a great game for free, if you're willing to resist all kinds of microtransactions and premium DLCs.

That is actually one of the problems with Free to Play games: you must not get "too naggy" about microtransactions, or your player will get annoyed and stop playing. Also your game must still have enough qualities to be played: if your game is evidently low-quality, no one will play it, not even if it's free.
