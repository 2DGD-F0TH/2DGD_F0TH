Marketing your game
====================

Here's my whole marketing idea: treat people the way you want to be treated.

An Important Note: Keep your feet on the ground
-----------------------------------------------

Let's be honest: the "indie success stories" you see everywhere are going to give you a false sense of hope, that "there is space for everyone in the industry".

I'm going to break it to you: if you're in for the money, you already lost.

The reality is that many game developers are horribly underpaid and many projects failed and many others are going to fail.

If you're in for the sake of creativity, to make something you want to make, seeing your project perform "under par" will hurts less, if at all. Your first project won't be a best-seller, but doing something you enjoy will make it better.

This book is meant to teach the basics of game development as a way to channel your creativity, and to help you understand the pitfalls and mistakes that can keep you from showing your best product, in the best possible way.

The importance of being consumer-friendly
-----------------------------------------

We live in a "Money-Driven" world. This is a fact, not an opinion. So, leaving morality out of the discussion, you can argue that the general game publisher mentality of "getting all the money" is not that wrong.
But you don't have to be an idealist to realize that we should see the world for what it could be, and not for what it is at the moment. We should apply this mentality to every aspect of our world, game industry included.

We are NOT here to enlighten you about how game industry has to change, but every game developer should realize that the true success of a game is **not** based on sales, it is based on customer satisfaction. So, even if this cursed "publisher mentality" could be applied to small indie developers (spoiler: it is not), we have to fight it back, and restore the "customer satisfaction above all" philosophy.
So, fun fact: the only thing we (small indie developers) can do is *doing the right thing*.

Focus your effort on customer satisfaction, you have to be consumer-friendly!

My first advice is: instead of implementing a thousand features, make one single thing a thousand times better (Bruce Lee style). If you promise the client a ton of features to do you can generate hype (we will discuss it later), but if you are an indie developer (and most of times even if you're not) making one thing extremely enjoyable is way better.

Why? Because your goal is to create something (even if it's only one thing) that will make the customer remember your game: Quality over Quantity.

Satisfying customers is no easy feat, we all know this. So one question you may ask is: How in hell can I be original? Answer is: You don't have to.

So, my second advice: There are million of games out there, so creating something never seen before is very, very, very, very difficult. So, try to innovate what already exists, make usual features in your own way. This is how sub-genres come to life.

You think this is not the right way? Then go and tell the people from `From Software` that the "Souls-like" sub-genere was not innovating.

Last advice: Gameplay over Graphics.

We're not Activision, we can't afford to spend 10 million bucks for a cutscene. Aim for the "old fashion gamers", the customers that play for fun, not because some game is gorgeous to see.
Whatever your working on, whatever your game genere is, focus on making the gameplay fun to play. Things are really this simple. Work 2 hours less on a model or sprite and 2 hours more on thinking about how to not get your customer bored.

:::: trivia ::::
Around July 2015 a game called "Brutal Force" (a clone of the more successful "Nuclear Throne") was hit with a wave of criticism after they raised their base price during a sale. The game was 75% off, but its sale price quickly went from 99Â¢ to $1.99 until it reached $3.24. The moral of the story is "never lie to your customers".
