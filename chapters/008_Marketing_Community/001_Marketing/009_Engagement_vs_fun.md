Engagement vs Fun
-----------------

In the games industry we can sometimes come across the terms "fun" and "engagement" in a way that makes them seem like synonyms, but they definitely aren't.

Let's start with the hardest to define: fun. Fun is really subjective, as humans each one of us has a radically different concept of "fun". The Oxford English dictionary comes to help us, in a way:

> Light-hearted pleasure, enjoyment, or amusement; boisterous joviality or merrymaking; entertainment.

This is a really broad definition, but the concept of "fun" itself is really broad and complex, and cannot become more than a few common points that we can define across games, thus making "designing fun" a form of art, instead of just an act of engineering.

"Player engagement" is completely different, it has a well-defined metric: play time.

It is possible to artificially extend the players' play time by tweaking the difficulty so that a player becomes frustrated enough to keep trying, but not enough to drop the game, occasionally adding a prize to keep the player gaming on (no matter how well-tweaked your experience is, without payoff players will leave sooner or later).

Is the player having fun when the experience is "tweaked" as such? Probably not, but the game is tailored so that the play time is longer.

The fun goes down, but the play time goes up. Fun and engagement are not the same thing.

"Player engagement" (and thus "play time") is one of the metrics that is used by big publishers to analyze and hook players into in-game economies and lootboxes, the more the player engages with your game, the more you can "advertise" lootboxes and in-game economies. These metrics take a bigger role when the game takes the form of a "live service".
