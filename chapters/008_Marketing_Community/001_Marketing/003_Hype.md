Managing Hype
--------------

It's time to discuss about promoting our works.

Let's start with an obvious (sadly not that much obvious) statement: We are **not** a big publisher, we cannot afford to make big mistakes.

Truth is that companies like EA, Ubisoft, Square Enix, ActiVision (and many more) can do pretty much everything they want. Why? Because they know that a massive part of their audience will buy the product "sight unseen", no matter what.

We are not in this situation, so we have to be very cautious. We must be aware that bad moves (not mentioning illegal ones) lead to major consequences, and most of the time indie developers cannot pay this price.

Most important thing to keep in mind is: never promise without keeping your word. This is very important, especially if you're making people pay and the game is not complete yet (so-called "Early Access").

You're not a big publisher, people don't trust you and will not pay you for a promise. You have to give them something worth the price, immediately enjoyable.
Overpricing your game and justifying that because of "future release/contents" is NOT going to work either.

Patreon (or crowdfunding websites in general) could be an interesting compromise for such situation, but you have to use it in the right way, and never abuse your supporters trust. Keep in mind all the basic tips for managing hype we just discussed, and make sure to respect promised releases/updates when related to a certain amount of income from your crowdfunding (so-called crowdfunding "goals").
