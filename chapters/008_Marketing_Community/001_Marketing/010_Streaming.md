Streamers and Content Creators
------------------------------

When you're developing or publishing a video game, you should not underestimate the power of so-called "content creators": streamers and YouTube stars, small or big, can turn your game from a niche project right into a cash buster.

Let's take some examples of games that, even though great on their own, would not be the same without streamers:

- **Minecraft:** this game is great on its own, but having a big number of streamers covering it definitely helped its growth, so much that Mojang got bought by Microsoft Corporation;
- **Fortnite:** even though pushed by a big company like Epic Games, this game benefited from the streaming community a lot;
- **Fall Guys:** published by Devolver Digital, this game cashes in on the "free for all/battle royale" genre, while giving a quirky and funny twist to it. Being a quirky game on its own right makes it an ideal game to stream, which definitely helped its sales.

I want to bring up one last example before delving into the nitty-gritty of the Streamers/Developers symbiotic relationship: **Among Us**.

"Among us" is a game that went from "unknown" to "cash buster" in a few weeks thanks to streaming. It got its "prime time" in 2020, after streamers brought it to light: it's a multiplayer, "Town of Salem"-like experience based on deception.

The thing is, this game was released in 2018, and it was not doing too well on its own, until streaming came in the picture. Being a very interactive game, this made it ideal for collaborations between streamer friends, striking a nice balance between suspect, suspense and strategy. After streamers came into play, the sales exploded.

The Content Creator/Developer symbiotic relationship is one of the best win/win situations that can happen in the video game development, let's see how.

### The game developers' side

For a game developer, having a game covered by a streamer has one big advantage: **free advertisement**.

Some big streamers can gather between 15.000 and 35.000 viewers *alone*, giving your game a huge boost in coverage. Most of the times the game is bought by the streamer themselves, with their own money, so you already sold a copy, but its worth is a lot more than meets the eye.

This boost in advertisement has consequences, if the game looks fun people will be encouraged to buy it, resulting in a surge in sales. The more the people who know about the game, the more it spreads via "word of mouth", furthering your sales.

There is no "traditional advertising" that can bring that much attention to your game.

### The Streamers' side

For a streamer, having a new game is definitely advantageous: it's fresh new content.

Fresh content keeps a streaming channel interesting, engaging the public, which in turn generates advertising revenue.

Such revenue can be spent by the streamer for better gear, but also new games which can bring even more fresh content to the channel, thus keeping viewer engagement high.

### Other entities and conclusions

This "symbiosis" doesn't limit itself to game developers and streamers: advertisers earn because their products are exposed, other game developers earn money by having their products bought to bring new content, gear manufacturers (keyboard, mice, monitors, cameras, lights, green screens, ...) get revenue from streamers looking to improve the quality of their streams. This is sector economic growth at its finest.

On October 22nd, 2020 the Creative Director at Google Stadia threw out the idea of making streamers pay a fee (or a revenue share) to game developers (or publishers) for the content they stream. Given what we just saw, and the great advantages it brings, having a "streamer tax" would remove content creators from the video game environment, nullifying all the good that comes from them.

Small streamers would not be able to pay such "tax", bigger ones would be willing to change their content (moving away from videogaming) to not pay such "tax" and not suffer many losses: people are watching streams because they like the streamer's behaviour, reactions and jokes, as well as gameplay style and technique. If people watched streamers and content creators for the games they play, views and subscriptions would not be as stable as they actually are.

It would be changing a system that works for one that will, in the most absolute way, not work.

One of the best things you can do as a game developer is harnessing the power of the streaming community: reach out to some small streamers, give out free keys, offer review copies, give out preview copies of DLCs, be friendly and supportive. Small streamers may become big ones one day, and supporting mutual growth is a really satisfying experience.
