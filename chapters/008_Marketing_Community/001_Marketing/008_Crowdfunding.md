Crowdfunding
-------------

Crowdfunding has been a small revolution in the world of the "idea to reality" business. You publish an idea, with a working sample and some explanation and people who are interested in your idea invest money.

This makes transforming an idea into reality a lot easier and removes a lot of economic worries from the developers.

Although for every good thing, there is always a pitfall: be it scams, things that utterly impossible to create or mismanagement, not everything that gets "funded" is going to go well.

Here are some tips that will help you in this confusing world.

### Communication Is Key

There is an Italian saying that can be translated to something like the following:

> A good worker must work, know, know how to work and let know about their work

This underlines that you may have knowledge and practice, but communication is a key factor in the success of any kind of work.

Remember to keep your backers updated at least weekly, avoid any language that could create misunderstandings (someone could misunderstand a "cutesy language" for a "mockery of the backers") and always justify your decisions. After all you're talking to your own investors.

### Do not betray your backers

Your backers are your first and most precious customers: they're the ones that bought your product "sight unseen", and invested money without knowing what the result will be.

Betraying your backers by taking unpopular decisions is a surefire way to see chargebacks and retaliation. If you suddenly decide to change the store where your game will be published to something different than promised, you better bring some **very strong** arguments for it.

Don't lie, if you receive a cash infusion to publish your product on a certain platform (even as a "temporary exclusive"), tell your backers about your decision and the reason being said cash infusion: some will understand, some won't like it, some will get angry. It's still better than everyone getting angry when they find out you lied to them.

### Don't be greedy

Greed is never well seen in the world of crowdfunding, having many projects asking for funds at the same time does not look good and opening a new crowdfunding campaign while a funded project has not yet been delivered looks even worse.

Having many ways to fund the same project may seem a good idea, but it usually isn't and gives out the impression of greed, not even to give the chance of "people who are late" to fund your project.

Another mistake are the so-called "stretch goals": encouragements to fund the project over its goal, in exchange for more features. This is a serious mistake that can break an entire project if you are not able to manage it correctly, because you're trading money for more work, and more work usually means a delayed release.

Stretch goals should be very few, already planned in the time table and well thought out. If they are not, you will pay for that mistake.

### Stay on the "safe side" of planning

A common mistake made by people who are getting started in development, is getting the times wrong. It happens. It's normal.

Planning a project is hard, and it's way too easy to get it wrong and find yourself with a deadline knocking at your door and having nothing functional in your hands.

> When you plan, you should always double your project duration - in case of unforeseen events.
> Then you should double that time again - in case of events you really cannot foresee.

### Keep your promises, or exceed them

When you present your idea, with a working sample (usually requested by many crowdfunding websites), you should keep in mind that people will use that sample as an "anchor": a fixed reference for the minimum quality expected for the product.

There is no "not game footage" that will save you. You promised, you have to deliver.

The only way to deliver a product that is different from the promised one, is to deliver something that is objectively better than what you promised (better graphics, gameplay, sound, story, features, ...)

### A striking case: Mighty No. 9

I want to spend a few words on a crowdfunding campaign that failed to meet expectations and broke all the rules we just saw.

The game was asking for a pledge of 900000\$, clearing that objective in just 2 days, and managed to raise over 4 Million \$ between kickstarter and PayPal. The game trailers showed great graphics, amazing soundtrack and fast-paced gameplay.

Sadly the crowdfunding was really mismanaged, the campaign updates happened often but were kind of disconnected with the reality of development and the campaign was littered with **SIXTEEN** stretch goals (with more foreseen, given the graphics in the kickstarter page).

The product delivered was under the expectations, the graphics were nothing like the trailers, they looked poor and cheap, the game was set to release in April 2015 but was delayed until June 2016.

The creator of the campaign was dreaming for a whole "Mighty No.9" franchise, with physical rewards and an animated series, but didn't make the cut, even after receiving almost 5 times the asked money and a partnership with the publisher Deep Silver.

What did this game get wrong?

- Too many stretch goals;
- Not delivered in the time promised (the game was delayed a lot of times);
- The final product was way under the expectations;
- Too many platforms to release on (10 of them!);
- The official trailer's "Make them cry like an Anime fan on prom night" - given that the game is very anime-like, this sounds a lot like a mockery to the fans and backers;
- Before delivering the game, the kickstarter account used for Mighty No. 9 was used to create a new kickstarter (Red Ash -Magicicada-), which does not look good when you're late in delivering a product;
- Too much to do for a project in its beginnings: there were physical releases and rewards planned, as well as an animated series and a whole franchise. This is too much of a gamble for a product that has still to get its first sale.

If you want to know more about what happened, there are a lot of YouTube videos and articles talking about the matter, it really makes you think about how you should behave when opening a crowdfunding campaign.
