Useful Algorithms
========================================

Path Finding
-------------

### The Best Greedy First Algorithm

\placeholder

<!-- TODO: Uses an heuristic to understand which node is the "best" locally, but doesn't necessarily make the best decision globally -->

### The Dijkstra Algorithm

\placeholder

<!-- TODO: Explain the dijkstra algorithm on nodes of a graph, can detect the closest goal among many -->


### The A* Algorithm

\placeholder

<!-- TODO: Variation of Dijkstra that uses heuristics for faster processing, does the best globally but doesn't support more than one goal -->

World Generation
----------------

### Recursive Backtracker Algorithm

\placeholder

<!-- TODO: Introduce the user to maze generation with the recursive backtracker algorithm -->

Noise Generation
-----------------

### Perlin Noise

\placeholder

<!-- TODO: Noise generation algorithm, runs in O(2^n) for n dimensions -->
