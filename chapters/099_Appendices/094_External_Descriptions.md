<!-- Cartesian Plane -->

Figure 1
: A Cartesian plane, representing a grid overlaid two axes, 90 degrees from each other. The X axis is represented with a double arrow going left to right. The Y axis is represented with a double arrow going bottom to top. The two axes cross each other in the center of the image (at the origin) and divide the plane in 4 quadrants which are numbered I, II, III, IV, starting from top right and going counterclockwise. Each axis is numbered from -8 to +8.

<!-- Vector -->

Figure 2
: The first quadrant of a Cartesian plane. An arrow starts from the origin $(0,0)$ and ends at the point $(4,1)$, 4 units on the positive X axis and 1 unit on the positive Y axis. The arrow represents a vector and has $(4,1)$ written near the tip of the arrow itself, representing the value of the vector.

<!-- Sum of vectors -->

Figure 3
: The first quadrant of a Cartesian plane. There are two arrows, named `u` (in red) and `v` (in black), representing two vectors. Both vectors start on the $(1,1)$ point, `u` ends on $(2,5)$, while `v` ends on $(5,2)$. Starting from the tip of `u` there is a copy of `v` and from the tip of `v` there's a copy of `u`. Both these copies have their tip on the point $(6,6)$. A dashed arrow called `s` represents the sum of `u` and `v`, starting from $(1,1)$ and ending in $(6,6)$.

<!-- Scalar-vector multiplication -->

Figure 4
: The first quadrant of a Cartesian plane. There is a red arrow representing a vector called $3v$ that goes from $(1,1)$ to $(4,7)$. Near the red arrow, there are 3 smaller black arrows, each one called `v`. The image demonstrates how $3v$ is long 3 times the vector `v`.

<!-- Scalar-vector multiplication 2 -->

Figure 5
: The first quadrant of a Cartesian plane. There is a red arrow representing a vector called $v$ that goes from $(2,1)$ to $(6,3)$. Near the red arrow, there are 2 smaller black arrows, each one called `0.5v`. The image demonstrates how $v$ is twice as long as the vector `0.5v`.

<!-- Scalar-vector multiplication 3 -->

Figure 6
: The first quadrant of a Cartesian plane. There is a black arrow representing a vector called `v` that goes from $(5,4)$ to $(7,5)$. There is a red arrow representing a vector called `-2v` that goes from $(5,4)$ to $(1,2)$. The image demonstrates that `-2v` is twice as long as `v` and has an opposite direction.

<!-- Convex shape -->
Figure 7
: A regular hexagon. Each vertex is named with letters from A to F, starting from the right most one, going counterclockwise. There is a dashed red line that goes through the shape at an about 30 degree incline, stopping on the CB and EF edges of the hexagon with blue dots.

<!-- Concave shape -->

Figure 8
: An irregular 7-sided shape, the shape reminds a bit of the letter C. Each vertex of the shape is named with letters from A to G, starting from the right most one, going counterclockwise. There is a dashed red line that goes from the top right (starting from the AB edge) down towards the bottom left (ending on the EF edge). The dashed red line has 4 blue dots on the edges AB, GA, FG and EF.

<!-- Self-intersecting shape -->

Figure 9
: A 4-sided self-intersecting shape, looking like two triangles joined at the tips (or a very stylized butterfly). Due to it being self-intersecting, each vertex is named with letters from A to D in the following order: top right, bottom left, top left, bottom right.

<!-- Projecting a point onto a line -->

Figure 10
: A line called `r` is shown, starting from the left side of the image, sloping downwards at about 30 degrees. A point called `P` is represented on top right of the image. A line is shown connecting P to the line `r` at a 90 degree angle of incidence. The point where such line meets `r` is called with $P_r$, which represents the projection of `P` onto `r`.
