Free assets and resources
=========================

In this appendix we'll take a look at a small list of websites that contain resources to help with the development of your game, like assets, royalty-free music and the like.

For each website we will have, along with a short description:

- **Website:** containing a link to the website where you can find the resources listed;
- **Resource Types:** a small table describing the kind of resources you will find on the website.

The licenses vary from website to website and even from single resource to another, so you should pay close attention to what you use and how you use it.

Openclipart is a website that contains lots of freely available cliparts , in vector format, that can be a good starting point for your own art: buttons, characters, symbols, ...

The website is currently (as of December 18th, 2020) undergoing a phase of transition, after switching backend and what seems to have been an attack by cyber-criminals.

It now features quite a confusing interface but now features a search function, but it's a precious source of art if you know what you're looking for.
