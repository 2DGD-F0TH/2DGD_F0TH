Engines, Libraries And Frameworks
=================================

Here follows a list of game engines, libraries and frameworks, so you can make an informed choice about your platform, or just try one!

For each proposed engine or framework, along with a short description, you will find the following sections:

- **Website:** This contains a link to the official website of the engine/framework/library;
- **License:** Here you will see if the product is free to use or if you need to pay a price for it, and anything in between;
- **Bindings:** In this table you will find if the product supports one of the many famous programming languages available, as well as the following:
    - **Dedicated Language:** This engine/framework makes use of its own scripting language, usually easier to learn than general-purpose languages. You may need to learn it;
    - **Visual Programming:** This product makes use of a "Visual Scripting" (codeless) paradigm, where you can program your own game without writing code, usually by using directed graphs and nodes.
- **Platform compatibility:** This will tell you if the product is good for your objective, by telling you which platforms you can deploy on, like Linux, Windows or even on the web via HTML5;

General Purpose {.unnumbered .unlisted}
---------------

General purpose engines are the basic frameworks that allow you to build any game you want, without being tied to a specific genre. These are the tools that give you the most freedom, but also will be a bit harder to master.
