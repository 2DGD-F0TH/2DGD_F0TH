Project Management Basics and tips
===================================

> "Oh no, why project management?"

Project management is a very broad topic but I feel that some basics and tips should be covered in this book, as knowing some project management can save you a lot of headaches and can make the difference between success and a colossal failure.

Be careful of feature creep
---------------------------

The "it would be cool to" trap, formally called "feature creep", is a huge problem in all projects that involve any amount of passion in them.

Saying "it would be cool to do xxxx: let's implement it!" can spiral out of control and make us implement new features forever, keeping us from taking care of the basics that make a good game (or make a game at all).

Try to stick to the basics first, and then eventually expand when your game is already released, if it's worth it: First make it work, only then make it work well.
