Project Management Basics and tips
===================================

\epigraph{Those who plan do better than those who do not plan even though they rarely stick to their plan.}{\textit{Winston Churchill}}

Project management is a very broad topic but I feel that some basics and tips should be covered in this book, as knowing some project management can save you a lot of headaches and can make the difference between success and a colossal failure.

Some generic tips
---------------------

### Be careful of feature creep

The "it would be cool to" trap, formally called "feature creep", is a huge problem in all projects that involve any amount of passion in them.

Saying "it would be cool to do xxxx: let's implement it!" can spiral out of control and make us implement new features forever, keeping us from taking care of the basics that make a good game (or make a game at all).

Try to stick to the basics first, and then eventually expand when your game is already released, if it's worth it: First make it work, only then make it work well.

### On project duration

When it comes to project management, it's always tough to gauge the project duration, so it can prove useful to remember the following phrase:

> "If you think a project would last a month, you should add a month of time for unforeseen events. After that, you should add another month for events that you really cannot foresee."

This means that projects will last at least 3 times the time you foresee.

Software Life Cycle Models
----------------------------

When talking about project management (in itself or in the broader field of Software Engineering) it is really useful to talk about some guideline models that can be used to manage your project.

### Iteration versus Increment

Before getting to the models, we need to discuss the difference between two terms that are often used interchangeably: "iteration" and "increment".

**Iteration** is a non-deterministic process, during an iteration you are revisiting what you have already done, and such revisiting can include an advancement or a regression. While iterating, you have no idea when you will finish your job.

**Increment** is deterministic instead, with increments you are proceeding by additions over a base. Every increment creates a "new base" for the next increments, and increments are numbered and limited, giving you an idea of when you have to finish your job.
