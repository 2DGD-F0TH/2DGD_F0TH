Project Management Basics and tips
===================================

\epigraph{Those who plan do better than those who do not plan even though they rarely stick to their plan.}{\textit{Winston Churchill}}

Project management is a very broad topic but I feel that some basics and tips should be covered in this book, as knowing some project management can save you a lot of headaches and can make the difference between success and a colossal failure.

Some generic tips
---------------------

### Be careful of feature creep

The "it would be cool to" trap, formally called "feature creep", is a huge problem in all projects that involve any amount of passion in them.

Saying "it would be cool to do xxxx: let's implement it!" can spiral out of control and make us implement new features forever, keeping us from taking care of the basics that make a good game (or make a game at all).

Try to stick to the basics first, and then eventually expand when your game is already released, if it's worth it: First make it work, only then make it work well.

### On project duration

When it comes to project management, it's always tough to gauge the project duration, so it can prove useful to remember the following phrase:

> "If you think a project would last a month, you should add a month of time for unforeseen events. After that, you should add another month for events that you really cannot foresee."

This means that projects will last at least 3 times the time you foresee.
