Conventions used in this book

### Logic Conventions

When talking about logic theory, the variables will be represented with a single uppercase letter, written in math mode: $A$

The following symbol will be used to represent a logical "AND": $\land$

The following symbol will be used to represent a logical "OR": $\lor$

The logical negation of a variable will be represented with a straight line on top of the variable, so the negation of the variable $A$ will be $\bar{A}$

### Code Listings

Code listings will be shown in monotype fonts, using syntax highlighting where possible:

    print(phrase)

<!-- Show how code lists are rendered, etc... -->
