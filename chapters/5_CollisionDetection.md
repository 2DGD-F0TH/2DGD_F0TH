Collision Reaction

### The Direction + Velocity Method

### The "Before and After" Method
<!-- Snapshot before and after updating, react accordingly, allows for more advanced stuff -->

-------------------

### The "Tile + Offset" Method
<!-- Useful for games like pacman, check the direction where you are going using the offset, if the next cell is a wall, react -->
