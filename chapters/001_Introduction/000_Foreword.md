Foreword
==========

Every time we start a new learning experience, we may be showered by a sleuth of doubts and fears. The task, however small, may seem daunting. And considering how large the field of Game Development can be, these fears are easily understandable.

This book is meant to be a reference for game developers, oriented at 2D, as well as being a collection of "best practices" that you should follow when developing a game by yourself (or with some friends).

But you shouldn't let these "best practices" jail you into a way of thinking that is not yours, actually my first tip in this book is **do not follow this book. Yet.**

Do it wrong.

Learn why these best practices exist by experience, make code so convoluted that you cannot maintain it anymore, don't check for overflows in your numbers, **allow yourself to do it wrong**.

Your toolbox is there to aid you, your tools don't have feelings that can be hurt (although they will grumble at you many times) in the same way that you cannot hurt a hammer when missing the nail head. You cannot break a computer by getting things wrong (at least 99.9999% of the time). Breaking the rules will just help you understand them better.

Write your own code, keep it as simple as you can, and practice.

Don't let people around you tell you that "you shouldn't do it that way", if you allow that to happen you're depriving yourself of a great opportunity to learn. Don't let others' "lion tamer syndrome" get to you, avoid complex structures as much as possible; cutting and pasting code will get you nowhere.

But most of all, never give up and try to keep it fun.

There will be times where you feel like giving up, because something doesn't work exactly as you want it to, or because you feel you're not ready to put out some code. When you don't feel ready, just try making something simple, something that will teach you how to manipulate data structures and that gives you a result in just a couple days of work. Just having a rectangle moving on the screen, reacting to your key presses can be that small confidence boost that can get you farther and farther into this world.

And when all else fails, take a pen, some paper and your favorite [Rubber Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) (make sure it is impact-proof) and **think**.

Coding is hard, but at the same time, it can give you lots of satisfaction.

I really hope that this book will give you tips, tricks and structures that one day will make you say "Oh yeah, I can use that!". So that one day you are able to craft an experience that someone else will enjoy, while you enjoy the journey that brings to such experience.
