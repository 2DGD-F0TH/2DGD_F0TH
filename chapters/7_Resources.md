### Using limited color palettes

<!-- TODO: Talk about how to make your art consistent using palettes, talk about DawnBringer's palette -->

### Dithering

Dithering (usually called "Color Quantization") is a technique used to give the illusion of a higher "color depth" when you're using a limited palette of colors.

The usage of dithering introduces patterns into the image when the pixels are visible, if instead the pixels are small enough the pattern will look like a new color, without actually introducing a new color into the palette.

Using two different levels of blue, we can use a dithering pattern to obtain a new tone of blue, like the following:

It's possible to study how your palette reacts to dithering using a dithering table, this will give you an idea of the colors available via dithering.

You can see a simple example of a dithering table here:

![Dithering Table Example](./images/resources/dithering_table.png)

You can see the palette colors on the top row and the left column, then you can see how dithering (in this case a simple checkerboard pattern) allows for different colors to pop out.

There are different dithering patterns, that allow for different type of colors, intensity and patterns:
