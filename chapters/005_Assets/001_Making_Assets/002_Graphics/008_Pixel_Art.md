#### Tools

When it comes to pixel art, your most used tools will be:

- **Pencil:** Its hard borders are ideal for base colors and outlines, allowing per-pixel editing without worrying about blur radius;
- **Brush:** The brush tool's soft borders are great for shading, in case you want to go for a more "hi-res" look;
- **Paint Bucket:** This is great for filling outlined ares with a base color. This allows also to create "zones" that help you distinguish between different parts of a sprite;
- **Eraser:** Great tool for removing stray pixels! Just make sure the eraser is set to delete the whole pixel and not just "make it more transparent looking".

Opacity options for tools are great for shading: you can take the same color and blend it with other existing colors, or make it stronger by going through the same area more than once. This makes the process more akin to real painting.

#### Layers

As with all other drawing styles, layers are your best friends in pixel art too. Just make sure to start with a transparent layer, since some drawing programs (for memory and CPU efficiency) won't let you easily add a "transparent background layer" afterwards.

Layers allow you to work on something new without affecting what's already "ready", as well as separate parts of a character (arms, legs, torso and head, for instance).

You can always "flatten the image" (merge all the layers into one) later.

#### Sub-pixel animation with palette cycling

When drawing pixel-art, artists may face what looks to be an insurmountable issue: pixels are a discrete measure which cannot be divided further.

This means that subtle movements may end up really difficult to represent: a character may look like it's laughing or shrugging, while it's only meant to breathe calmly (for instance in an idle animation).

This is where sub-pixel animation comes into play: the basic idea is to play with the colors inside what you're drawing in a way that simulates movement, but the overall shape of the subject doesn't change (or is delayed in such a way that the change of shape looks smoother).

This technique is called "palette cycling": by alternating two shades of the same colors in rapid succession, you are able to simulate animations that give the illusion of being "smaller than a single pixel".
