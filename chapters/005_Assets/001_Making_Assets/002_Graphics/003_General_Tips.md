### General Tips

In this section we will take a look at some basic art tips that will give you some indication on how to create your own art for your very own game. This will be pointers to keep you going.

#### Practice, Practice, Practice...

As with all forms of art, the secret to "getting good" is practice. There's no way to avoid it, your first piece may been nice or flat out terrible, your next one will be better, and the one after that will be even better... Hard work always beats "talent" in the long run.

#### References are your friends

References are a tricky topic, some artists swear by it, others oppose them fiercely.

In my opinion, looking at a real-life version of what you want to draw can be one of the most useful things you can do when drawing. Even when drawing something that involved a huge amount of fantasy, having a reference can give you indications on shapes and sizes.

It doesn't have to be a one-to-one reference either, you can get ideas for your dragon from crocodiles and lizards, or even snakes!

#### Don't compare your style to others'

One of the most frustrating things that can happen when learning something new, is comparing yourself to another artist and saying "I should be able to draw like them".

Everyone has their own unique style, and you should work on what makes it unique, instead of comparing your style to others.

#### Study other styles

This ties a bit to the previous point, you should not compare to others, but you should also take some time to look at other people's work, find what you like about it and implement it into your own art style.

Looking around you can help you grow as an artist and aid you in the difficult seeking of your own art style.

#### Learn to deconstruct objects into shapes

Every complex object can be deconstructed into simpler shapes: circles, ellipses, triangles, rectangles, squares...

You can use such simple shapes, overlapping them to create a skeleton of your subject (living or not), so that you can draw it in an easier way: with the layer system introduced by huge part of the current drawing applications, you don't have to do precision work when it comes to removing such skeleton.
