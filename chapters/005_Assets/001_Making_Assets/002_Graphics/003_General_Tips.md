### General Tips

In this section we will take a look at some basic art tips that will give you some indication on how to create your own art for your very own game. This will be pointers to keep you going.

#### Practice, Practice, Practice...

As with all forms of art, the secret to "getting good" is practice. There's no way to avoid it, your first piece may been nice or flat out terrible, your next one will be better, and the one after that will be even better... Hard work always beats "talent" in the long run.

#### References are your friends

References are a tricky topic, some artists swear by it, others oppose them fiercely.

In my opinion, looking at a real-life version of what you want to draw can be one of the most useful things you can do when drawing. Even when drawing something that involved a huge amount of fantasy, having a reference can give you indications on shapes and sizes.

It doesn't have to be a one-to-one reference either, you can get ideas for your dragon from crocodiles and lizards, or even snakes!

#### Don't compare your style to others'

One of the most frustrating things that can happen when learning something new, is comparing yourself to another artist and saying "I should be able to draw like them".

Everyone has their own unique style, and you should work on what makes it unique, instead of comparing your style to others.

#### Study other styles

This ties a bit to the previous point, you should not compare to others, but you should also take some time to look at other people's work, find what you like about it and implement it into your own art style.

Looking around you can help you grow as an artist and aid you in the difficult seeking of your own art style.

#### Learn to deconstruct objects into shapes

Every complex object can be deconstructed into simpler shapes: circles, ellipses, triangles, rectangles, squares...

You can use such simple shapes, overlapping them to create a skeleton of your subject (living or not), so that you can draw it in an easier way: with the layer system introduced by huge part of the current drawing applications, you don't have to do precision work when it comes to removing such skeleton.

#### Graphics Smearing

No matter how good our graphics are and how high our frame rate, there are very few things that give the same effect of "smearing" when it comes to animations: deforming an image to make it look more dynamic when animated by simulating "motion blur".

Sometimes graphics smearing are referred to "smear frames" or "elongated inbetweens".

Smearing has been used in animation for decades (since the 1930s!): just take any famous animated movie from the late 20th century and pause at any moment, you'll probably find one. Some are actually quite funny to look at, others may be even disturbing!

:::: trivia ::::
It has been used in 3D graphics too, for example in the famous game "Crash Bandicoot" features smearing for the spin move: changing the model with a "smeared version" was less resource-intensive than more realistic "motion blur" techniques back in the PS1 era, plus it matched the "cartoony mood" of the game.

There are programs dedicated to help you with animating and smearing pixel art, but don't fear to experiment by manually smearing frames using your favourite paint program: some interesting results (even if not the ones you were looking for at that moment) might arise!
