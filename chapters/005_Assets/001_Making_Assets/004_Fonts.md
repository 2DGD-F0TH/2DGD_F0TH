### Font Categories

Before starting with fonts and the ways they can be integrated in your game, we should start with some definitions and categorizing fonts by their own characteristics.

#### Serif and Sans-Serif fonts

In typography, *serifs* are small strokes that get attached to larger strokes in a letter (or symbol) of certain fonts. The font families that make use of serifs are called **serif fonts** or **serif typefaces**.

Serif fonts look more elegant and give a "roman" feeling (in fact, serif fonts are also called *roman* typefaces) and are good for games that take place in historical settings or need a semblance of pretend "historical importance" (in their own world).

Serif fonts look better on paper and could come out as a bit harder to read on screens. A famous serif font is Times New Roman.

On the opposite side, we have **sans-serif fonts**, where such small strokes are absent. Sans-Serif fonts seem easier to read on screens and look simpler, but they don't look as good on paper, when long text bodies are involved.

A famous sans-serif font is Arial.

#### Proportional and Monospaced fonts

The majority of fonts used today are **proportional**, where each letter occupies its own space proportional to its own width. Examples of proportional fonts are Times New Roman and Arial.

Notice the difference in width between certain pairs of letters, like "i" and "o" or "a" and "l".

Proportional fonts are good for general text that don't have any particular constraint.

On the opposite side, there are **monospaced** fonts, also called **fixed-width** fonts. In these font families, each letter occupies the same amount pre-defined width.

Again, notice how all letters occupy the same horizontal space.

Monospaced fonts are used for computer texts, coding and ascii-art. Examples of monospaced fonts are Courier New and Inconsolata.
