### DAW Basics

#### What is a DAW Software?

Digital Audio Workstation Software (DAW Software) are pieces of software that have extensive recording, playback and editing features, allowing you to create your own songs, given some instrument samples (or pre-recorded tracks).

They also feature mixing facilities, waveform display and track controls, some even feature (the software equivalent of) effect racks, such as equalizers, to further the possibilities of creating your work in the best way possible.

#### The Piano Roll

Have you ever seen one of those pianos that seem to have an integrated music box? That is a so-called "piano roll" and is used to store music and play it back on the piano.

Most Software DAW have a similar abstraction, called "piano roll" too.

In the previous image, we can see four notes, each defined by its vertical position (respectively a C5, C6, A5, F#5) and length (respectively a single whole/semibreve and three half/minim notes). In the previous example each vertical green bar represents $\frac{1}{4}$ and each light green bar represents a beat. This should help you imagining how to compose something.

Different systems have different piano roll variations. For instance:

This Software DAW has a different shape for the notes, meaning a certain kind of effect is applied to them. All the basic principles still apply, though.

The piano roll abstraction allows you to edit your music easily, by grabbing notes and moving them, or making them longer by dragging their edges.
