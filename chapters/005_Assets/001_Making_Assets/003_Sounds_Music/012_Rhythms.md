### Basic Rhythms

When composing music, we may not know where to start: this is the objective of this section: give you some easy rhythms to start with. Here I will use LMMS's beat+bassline editor to represent the notes, as it's the easiest to understand.

Remember to check your tempo too, since it may make the difference between something akin to the "house" genre and something more "techno".

#### Four on the floor

This is the most basic rhythm there is: let's consider a situation where we have 16 beats per bar (so each note is 1/16th):

The four on the floor rhythm uses a kick drum in the 1st, 5th, 9th and 13th beat, giving a constant rhythm.

This is practically the basic of all dance-based music.

#### Four on the floor with off-beat hi-hats

A basic rhythm like the "four on the floor", by itself, can prove to be quite boring. To spice it up, we can add some closed hi-hats in the off-beats, like the following:

If you listen closely, a lot of music has this basic pattern mixed into it, in one way or another.

#### A simple rock beat

By using hi-hats, a kick drum and a snare drum, you can create a very simple rock beat. Keep 4 beats in a bar, each beat put a hi-hat, on 1 and 2 put a kick drum and on 3 a snare drum.
