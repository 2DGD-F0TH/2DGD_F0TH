### Some audio processing tips

Sometimes you may find yourself being a bit confused about what to do with your audio samples and music, so here's a small list of tips to make your life that tiny bit easier when it comes to processing audio.

#### Prefer cutting over boosting

Sometimes we may find our audio samples lacking that "punch" they would need, the first idea we may have would be to use a "bass boost" filter to make the low frequencies more prominent. Most of the time, this is not a good idea, since boost filters can create artifacts.

It's better to cut the higher frequencies instead, and eventually boost the entire volume of the sample during mixing. This way the nature of the sample doesn't get tainted by boosting, and we obtain the result we wanted.
