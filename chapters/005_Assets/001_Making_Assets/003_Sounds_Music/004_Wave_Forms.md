### Basic Wave Forms

It is important to know how the main wave forms look and sound in order to understand how to create your own instruments, as well as having a further insight on how older 8-bit games sounded.

It is suggested to look for each sine wave on the internet and hear how it sounds, here we will briefly talk about the main waveforms, their shape and uses.

#### Sine Wave

A sine wave has an amplitude that follows a trigonometric sine wave, it sounds really "pure" and is usually used at 440Hz to tune instruments in A.

In games it is usually used to give out the impression of a flute-like instrument.

#### Square Wave

A square wave looks... square-like. It is one of the most used waves in 8-bit music, sounds a bit rougher than a sine wave and is used for beeps and blips.

In game music it is normally used as lead instrument, and with various modulations, it can sound like a xylophone or a piano, or at least a very artificial rendition of those.

The NES had 2 voices (or channels) dedicated to square waves.

#### Triangle Wave

A triangle wave is another very used wave in 8-bit music, given it's very "muted" characteristics it can be used to give songs a "bass track" of some sort.

The NES had one channel completely dedicated to triangle waveforms.

#### Sawtooth Wave

Sawtooth waves were a staple of the Commodore64 era, with its "gritty", "bzzt" sound which can sound a lot like a trombone on long notes.

#### Noise

Noise is not a real, static waveform, but more like what comes out when the amplitude has a random value on each sample.

Noise can be used (with the right modulation and processing) to simulate percussions.

The NES had one channel completely dedicated to noise waveforms.
