### Some audio basics

Before creating sounds and music, we need to clarify some terminology, as well as learn some basics before diving into FM synthesis like wave forms. After that we can learn about trackers and Software DAWs.

In this section we will learn about sample rate, bit depth, lossy/lossless formats and clipping, among other things.

#### Sample Rate

Differently from Analog Audio, which is continuous (as in has an infinite amount of detail), Digital Audio is a stream of numbers (ones and zeros) that is "discrete" in nature. That means that we blast these numbers thousands of times a second to be able to build a decent sounding sound.

The number of times we record such numbers from our digital microphone (as well as the number of times we blast such numbers back from our speakers) is called **sample rate** and it is measured in *Hz*.

The more the samples per second, the more detail we can squeeze into our audio files, but at the same time the bigger the file will become too.

In normal CD-Audio, we have a sample rate of 44100 Hz, which means that we recorded a sample 44100 times in a single second.

When making our game's audio, we should always stay around such value, since going lower would make the audio sound worse, since we lower the amount of information the audio itself has.

Also we should avoid using weird sample rates, here are some the most commonly used:

- 44.1kHz (or 44100 Hz if you prefer), used in the CD Audio format;
- 48kHz, used in Pro Audio contexts;

While working with audio (mixing and editing), we can go higher:

- 88.2kHz - Double the CD Audio standard, used to record and recreate more frequencies;
- 96kHz used in some serious Professional audio contexts.

#### Bit Depth

Along with sample rate, there is another value in audio that expresses its quality: the bit depth.

The bit depth defines how many "volume values" we can have in a single sample, which shapes the quality of the sound in a different way than sample rate.

If our audio has a 1-bit bit depth, each sample will have only 2 values:

- **0:** Mute
- **1:** Blast at full volume

Which strongly reduces the quality of the audio.

In Pok√®mon Yellow for GameBoy, Pikachu's voice was encoded with in 1-bit depth.

If we had a 2-bit depth, we could make each sample have more volume values:

- 00: Mute
- 01: 33% volume
- 10: 66% volume
- 11: 100% volume

Usually audio has a 16 Bit depth, but more modern systems make use of 24 Bits or even 32 Bits.

#### Lossless Formats

As with graphics, there are audio formats that allow you to store uncompressed information, as well as compressed (but without losses) sounds. The most common lossless audio formats include:

- WAV (uncompressed);
- AIFF (usually uncompressed, but AIFF-C supports both lossless and lossy compression);
- FLAC (lossless compression).

#### Lossy Formats

As with graphics, there are also "lossy formats" that allow us to store information in even less space by getting rid of information that is considered outside our hearing spectrum, for instance. Some of the most known are:

- Mpeg Layer 3 (MP3);
- OGG Vorbis;
- Windows Media Audio (WMA);
- Advanced Audio Codec (AAC).

#### Clipping

Clipping is a phenomenon when you're trying to output (or record) a wave that exceeds the capacity of your equipment. As a result, the wave is "clipped" (cut) and there is a very audible distortion.

You surely heard clipping in audio before, usually when people scream on a low-quality microphone and the audio gets distorted.

The best way to repair clipping is to re-record the audio completely, although some tools can help in case you absolutely cannot re-record the audio.

Also you should be wary of clipping, because there may be cases where it damages your audio equipment.
