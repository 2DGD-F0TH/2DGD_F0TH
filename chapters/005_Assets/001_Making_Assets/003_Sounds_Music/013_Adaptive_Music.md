### Adaptive Music

Adaptive Music (sometimes called "dynamic music" or "interactive music") is a background music track that reacts to the events of the game. Such reactions can involve volume, rhythm, tune, adding new instruments (adding drums, for instance).

A simple example of Adaptive Music can be found in Super Mario World, where hopping on Yoshi will add or change the drum beats on the level's music track.
