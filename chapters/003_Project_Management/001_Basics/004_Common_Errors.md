Common Errors and Pitfalls
---------------------------

When you are making a new game, it's easy to feel lost and "out of your comfort zone", and that's okay! It's also easy to fall into traps and pitfalls that can ruin your experience, here we take a look at the most common ones.

### Losing motivation

Sometimes it can happen to lose motivation, usually due to having "too much ambition": make sure you can develop the kind of game you want to make, for instance leave multiplayer out of the question (multiplayer games are really hard and network code can be a real pain to work on). It will just suck up development time, and it isn't that much of an important feature anyway (and it can still be implemented later, like it happened in *Stardew Valley*).

Like in music, many people prefer "mediocrity" to "something great", so don't force yourself to innovate: do things well enough and if the innovative idea comes, welcome it.

If you get tired, take a break, you're your own boss, and no one is behind you zapping you with a cattle prod: just focus on making a good overall product and things will go well.

### The "Side Project" pitfall

It happens: you have a ton of ideas for games of all kinds, and probably you'll start thinking:

> What's bad about a small "side project"? I want to change things up a bit...

You will end up having lots of "started projects" and nothing finished, your energy will deplete, things will become confusing and you won't know what game you're working on anymore.

Instead, make a small concept for the new mechanic and try to implement it in your current game, you may find a new mix that hasn't been tried before, making your game that much more unique.

### Making a game "in isolation"

While making a game you will need to gather some public for it, as well as create some hype around it: making a game on your own without involving the public is a mistake that deprives you of a huge source of suggestions and (constructive) criticism (as well as satisfaction, when you manage to get some people interested in your game).

Make your game public, on platforms like `itch.io` or `IndieDB`, get feedback and encouragement. Create trailers towards the end of development, put them on `YouTube` or `Vimeo` and if you want to go all out, get in touch with the press (locally first) and create hype around your product.

### (Mis)Handling Criticism

Among all the other things that are happening, we also need to handle feedback from our "potential players", and this requires quite the mental effort, since we can't make it "automatic".

Not all criticism can be classified as "trolling", and forging our game without listening to any feedback will only mean that such game won't be liked by as many people as we would like, maybe for a very simple problem that could have been solved if only we listened to them.

At the same time, not all criticism is "useful" either, not classifying criticism as "trolling" does not mean that trolling doesn't exist, some people will take pride in ruining other people's mood, either by being annoying and uselessly critic, or by finding issues that don't actually exist.

The question you should ask yourself is simple:

> Is this criticism I'm receiving constructive? Can it make my game better?

If the answer is no, then you may want to ignore such criticism, but if it is constructive, maybe you want to keep it in consideration.

#### Misusing of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act

This is what could be considered the apex of mishandling criticism: the usage of DMCA takedowns to quash criticism towards your game.

Sadly, mostly in the YouTube ecosystem, DMCA takedowns are often used as a means to suppress criticism and make video-reviews disappear from the Internet. Useless to say that this is **potentially illegal** as well as **definitely despicable**.

Takedowns according to the DMCA are a tool at your disposal to deal with copyright infringements by people who steal part (or the entirety of) your work, allowing (in the case of YouTube at the very least) to make the allegedly infringing material. This should be used carefully and just after at the very least contacting the alleged infringer privately, also because there is an exception to the copyright rule.

##### The Fair Use Doctrine

The so-called "Fair Use" is a limited exception to the copyright law that targets purposes of review, criticism, parody, commentary, and news reporting, for instance.

The test for "Fair use" has four factors (according to 17 U.S.C. ยง107):

1. **The Purpose and character of the use:** if someone can demonstrate that their use advances knowledge or the progress of arts through the addition of something new, it's probably fair use. This usually is defined by the question "is the work **transformative** enough?"
2. **The nature of the copyrighted work:** For instance, facts and ideas are not protected by copyright, but only their particular expression or fixation is protected. Essentially you can't really sue someone for making a game very similar to yours (For instance making a 2D sidescrolling, run'n'gun platformer).
3. **The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the work as a whole:** If someone uses a small part (compared to the whole) of the work, and if that part is not really substantial, then it's probably fair use.
4. **The effect on the potential market for the copyrighted work:** this defines if the widespread presence of the "allegedly infringing use" can hinder on the copyright owner's ability to exploit (earn from) their original work.

There can also be some additional factors that may be considered, but these four factors above are usually enough to decide over the presence (or absence) of fair use.

##### The "Review Case"

Let's take a simple example: a video-review on our brand new videogame, that takes some small pieces of gameplay (totaling about 5 minutes), on video and comments on the gameplay, sound and graphics. A very common scenario with (I hope) an unsurprising turnout.

Let's take a look at the first point: the purpose is criticism, the review brings something new to the table (essentially **it is transformative**): someone's impression and comments about the commercial work.

Second point: the game is an interactive medium, while the review is non-interactive by nature, the mean of transmission is different.

Third point: considering the average duration of 8 to 10 hours of a videogame, 5 minutes of footage amounts for around $0.8\%$ to $1\%$ of the total experience, that's a laughable amount compared to the total experience.

Fourth Point: this is the one many people may get wrong. A review can have a huge effect on the market of a copyrighted work (a bad score from a big reviewer can result in huge losses), but that's not really how the test works. The fourth test can usually be answered by the following questions:

> What's the probability that someone would buy (or enjoy for free) the work from the alleged infringer, instead than from me (the copyright owner)?

This is called "being a direct market substitute" for the original work. The other question is:

> Is there a potential harm (other than market substitution) that can exist?

This usually is related to licensing markets. And here lies the final nail on the coffin: there is no direct market substitution and courts recognize that certain kinds of market don't negate fair use, and reviews are among those kinds of market. In essence **Copyright is not a shield against adverse criticism**.

### Not letting others test your game

This is a common mistake when you are focused on making the game: using your own skill as a "universal measure" for the world's skill level. You may be an unknown master at 2D platformers, and as such what is "mildly difficult" for you may be "utterly impossible" for the average player. Or the opposite.

Try to keep the challenge constant through the levels, applying the usual slight upwards curve in difficulty that most games have (or check the section about [difficulty curves](#diff_curves) for some ideas), and let others test your game.

A beta version with feedback capabilities (or just a beta version and a form or email address can do the trick too) is pure gold when it comes to understanding what your players think about the game's challenge level.

Remember: when a level is (perceived as unfairly) too hard, players will stop playing the game.

### Being perfectionist

If you are called "perfectionist" by your friends, that should be a red flag in your game development process from the very beginning.

Finding yourself honing the game over and over, allocating countless hours (that always feel as "not enough") into making the game "better", will end up just sabotaging the development process itself.

Instead try to prefer a more "scientific approach", where you study your game's shortcomings (with the help of some testers, or "friend-made-tester"), order them by their "effort vs improvement" ratio and start with those who require the lowest effort compared to the improvements they bring.

You can see that you can get really good returns for relatively little effort, but if you're a perfectionist, you may want to push forward and put more and more hours, with diminishing returns.

This means that when you have:

- Good Visuals and Good Audio
- Working Gameplay
- A challenge that lasts the test of time
- The testing phase completed

You have a complete product. **Release it**. Updating it is very easy these days, and maybe that will give you the mental energy to undertake a new game. Maybe a sequel even?

### Using the wrong engine

The game engine is one of the most important decisions you can take at the beginning of your game development journey. Realizing that you used the wrong engine after months of development can be a huge setback, as well as a "black hole" for your motivation.

Don't trust market hype over an engine, and don't trust the vendor's promises either.

Does the game engine have the features you will need **already**? No? Then your money should stay where it is, and you should look somewhere else.

If such engine's producer is promising the feature you want in future, don't trust it, that version may come, or it may never come at all. If you bought the engine and such feature won't ever be there, your money won't come back.
