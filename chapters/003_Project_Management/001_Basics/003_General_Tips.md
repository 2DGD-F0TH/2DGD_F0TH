Some general tips
-----------------

### Be careful of feature creep

The "it would be cool to..." trap, formally called "feature creep", is a huge problem in all projects that involve any amount of passion in them.

Saying "it would be cool to do `<insert something here>`: let's implement it!" can spiral out of control and make us implement new features forever, keeping us from taking care of the basics that make a good game (or make a game at all).

Try to stick to the basics first, and then eventually expand when your game is already released, if it's worth it: first make it work, then make it work well and only in the end make it elegant.

### On project duration

When it comes to project management, it's always tough to gauge the project duration, so it can prove useful to remember the following phrase:

> "If you think a project would last a month, you should add a month of time for unforeseen events. After that, you should add another month for events that you really cannot foresee."

This means that projects will last at least 3 times the time you foresee.

That may seem a lot like an exaggeration, but unforeseen events happen and they can have a huge impact on the release of your game. It's better to err on the side of caution and even delay the release if something goes wrong. Shigeru Miyamoto said the following:

> A delayed game is eventually good, a bad game is bad forever.

so maybe being "abundant" with your time estimates is not that wrong.

### Brainstorming: the good, the bad and the ugly

Brainstorming is an activity that involves the design team writing down all the ideas they possibly can (without caring about their quality yet).

This is a productive activity to perform at the beginning of the game development and design process, but it can be a huge source of feature creep if done further down the line.

After the initial phase of brainstorming, the team analyzes the ideas and discards the impossible ones, followed by the ones that are not "as good as they sounded at first". The remaining ideas can come together to either form a concept of a videogame or some secondary component of it.

In short: brainstorming is a great activity for innovation, but since it's essentially "throwing stuff at a wall and see what sticks".

This activity can sometimes be either unproductive or "excessively productive": in both cases we end up with nothing of use in our hands.

### On Sequels

In case your game becomes a hit, you will probably think about making a sequel: this is not inherently a bad thing, but you need to remember some things.

When developing a sequel, you will have to live up to your previous game, as well as the expectations of the players, and this becomes more and more difficult as the "successful sequels" go on.

Not only a sequel must be "as good or better" than its predecessor, but also it should add something to the original game, as well as the established lore (if there is any).

Your time and resource management must be top-notch to be able to "bring more with less", since your need for resources cannot skyrocket without a very good reason.

Also don't get caught in the some kind of "sequel disease" where you end up making a sequel just to "milk the intellectual property": you will end up ruining the whole series: it may end up being hated by the ones who played the first games, and new players will be discouraged by a series that either overstays its welcome, or has one or more low-quality sequels.
