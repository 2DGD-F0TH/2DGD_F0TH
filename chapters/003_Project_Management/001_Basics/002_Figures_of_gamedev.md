The figures of game design and development
------------------------------------------

Before delving into the topic at hand, we need to familiarize ourselves with the main figures that are involved in the process of game design and development, since you'll probably (if you are the only developer of your game) have to take upon all their tasks.

### Producer/Project Manager

:::::::::::::::::::

The producer is a figure that has experience in many fields and has an overall view of the project. They essentially keep the project together.

Their duties are:

- Team Building (and its maintenance too);
- Distributing duties and responsibilities;
- Relations with the media.

Under the term "project manager" you can find different roles, among them:

- Product Manager;
- Assistant Producer;
- Executive producer.

A good project manager will need tools to manage tasks (Like a Kanban Board), as well as tools that promote communication in the team (Chats, VoIP) and information repositories (having all information in the same place is important!).

### Game Designer

:::::::::::::::::::

The game designer takes care of the game concept, usually (but not only!) working with really specific software, usually provided by the programmers in the team (like specific level editors).

They design balanced game mechanics, manage the learning curve and take care of level design too.

Under the "Game Designer" term you can find different roles, among them:

- Level Designer;
- World Builder;
- Narrative Designer;
- Quest/Mission Designer.

A good game designer must know mathematics, some scripting and be able to use planning tools (again, our friendly Kanban Board comes into play) as well as diagram drawing tools.

### Writer

:::: centering ::::

:::::::::::::::::::

Writers are the ones who can help you give your game its own story, but also help with things that are outside the mere game itself.

Some of their jobs include:

- Writing tutorial prompts;
- Writing narration;
- Writing dialogue;
- Writing pieces for the marketing of your game (sometimes known as "Copywriting").

Under the term of "Writer" you can find more roles, like:

- Editor;
- Narrative Designer;
- Creative Writer.

A good writer must have good language skills, as well as creativity. They must be able to use planning programs (like everyone, communication is important) as well as writing programs, like LibreOffice/OpenOffice Writer.

### Developer

:::: centering ::::
![](./images/project_management/developer.svg){width=40%}
:::::::::::::::::::

Logic and mathematics are the strong suit of programmers, the people who take care of making the game tick, they can also have many specializations like:

- Problem Solver
- Game mechanics programmer;
- Controls programmer;
- AI developer;
- Visuals Programmer;
- Networking programmer;
- Physics programmer;
- ...

They must be familiar with IDEs and programming environments, as well as Source Control Tools (Like Git), knowledge of game engines like Unity is preferred, but also tied to the kind of game that is made.

### Visual Artist

:::: centering ::::

:::::::::::::::::::

In 2D games visual art is as important as in 3D games and good graphics can really boost the game's quality greatly, as bad graphics can break a game easily.

Among visual artists we can find:

Both in 2D and 3D games:

- 2D Artists;
- Animators;
- Environment Artists;
- UI Artists/Designers;
- Conceptual Artists.

In 3D games:

- 3D Modelers;
- Texture Artists.

Visual Artists must be knowledgeable in the use of drawing programs, like Krita, GIMP or their commercial counterparts.

### Sound Artist

:::: centering ::::

:::::::::::::::::::

As with graphics, sound and music can make or break a game. Sound artists may also be musicians, and their task is to create audio that can be used in a video game, like sound effects, atmospheres or background music.

Under the umbrella of a sound artist, you can find:

- Audio Engineers;
- Game Composers;
- Music Mixers;
- Voice actors;
- Audio Programmers.

The knowledge of DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) software is fundamental, as well as knowing some so-called "middlewares", like FMOD. Another important bit of knowledge is being able to use Audio editors effectively.

### Marketing/Public Relations Manager

:::: centering ::::
![](./images/project_management/marketing.svg){width=40%}
:::::::::::::::::::

Even the best game in the world will get no attention without someone who takes care of letting people know about it. The marketing and public relations manager is responsible for promoting a game through various channels, from specialized outlets to social media.

Their job include:

- developing and executing marketing campaigns;
- creating press releases and other promotional materials;
- managing social media accounts;
- working with journalists and influencers to publicize the game;
- publicizing the game on dedicated trade shows.

### Tester

:::: centering ::::
![](./images/project_management/tester.svg){width=40%}
:::::::::::::::::::

Probably the most important job in a game development team, testing needs people with high attention to detail, as well as the ability to handle stress well.

Testers are able to find, describe and help you reproduce bugs and misbehaviors of your game.
