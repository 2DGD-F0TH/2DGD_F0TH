Balancing Your Game
===================

The trick to balance is to not make sacrificing important things become the norm

An imbalanced game is a frustrating game, and most of the time balancing a game is one of the toughest challenges a game developer/designer can find themselves to have to face.

Let's talk about some principles and guidelines that can help you balancing your game and keep your players challenged but not frustrated.

Do not annoy the player
-----------------------

The "master principle" everyone should follow (in my humble opinion) is "do not, under any circumstance, annoy the player".

You should not trade the "fun" of your game for any other mechanic (like showing an advertisement to allow them to continue playing): that is equivalent to betraying your player, makes the game feel unfair and un-fun.

Here are some examples of mechanics that will surely annoy the player:

- **Sudden spikes in difficulty:** when you have a sudden spike in difficulty, the player feels stumped and the game tends to lose its charm, you are "interrupting the flow" of the game by placing an arbitrary hurdle on your players' road;
- **Off-screen instant-death traps:** having something deadly that pops out from off-screen and kills the player is unfair and will make your players scream in agony and vexation, if you want to place some obstacles that pop from off-screen you should "telegraph" them. "Telegraphing" is a technique where you send a warning signal to the player that danger is coming. For instance a huge laser that instantly kills you should be preceded by a couple seconds by a yellow "!" signal on the right side of the screen, where the laser is due to strike. Another way to telegraph said laser would be to illuminate the part of the screen that is about to be hit, like the light of the laser is coming up;
- **Arbitrary invisible time limits:** If you suddenly interrupt the player's game with a "time up" and you have no countdown on the screen, the player will get frustrated, guaranteed;
- **Taking control away from the player:** Not allowing the player to move (getting blocked by an enemy and killed) or just not allowing the player to adjust their jump mid-air is a surefire way to make them not play your game anymore.

Favour the player when possible
-------------------------------

In the process of balancing a game, as a game developer/designer you will surely find yourself in front of the following decision time and time again:

> Shall I favour the game's precision or should I give some leeway to the player?

The answer is the latter 99% of the time.

Giving some leeway to the player, for instance by having a more generous hit-box that allows you to stay alive even if a bullet grazes your character makes the game seem more "fair".

There are infinite ways to make a game challenging without having to force the player into accepting very precise hit-boxes or extremely tight gameplay.
