Writing a Game Design Document
===============================

One of the most discussed things in the world of Game Development is the so-called "GDD" or "Game Design Document". Some say it's a thing of the past, others swear by it, others are not really swayed by its existence.

Being an important piece of any software development process, in this book we will talk about the GDD in a more flexible way.

What is a Game Design Document
-------------------------------

The Game Design Document is a Body Of Knowledge that contains everything that is your game, and it can take many forms, such as:

- A formal design document;
- A Wiki~[g]~;
- A Kanboard ~[g]~.

The most important thing about the GDD is that it contains all the details about your game in a centralized and possibly easy-to-access place.

It is not a technical document, but mostly a design document, technical matters should be moved to a dedicated "Technical Design Document".

Possible sections of a Game Design Document
--------------------------------------------

Each game can have its own attributes, so each Game Design Document can be different, here we will present some of the most common sections you can include in your own Game Design Document.

### Project Description

This section is used to give the reader a quick description of the game, its genre (RPG, FPS, Puzzle,...), the type of demographic it covers (casual, hardcore, ...). Additional information that is believed to be important to have a basic understanding of the game can be put here.

This section should not be longer than a couple paragraphs.

A possible excerpt of a description could be the following:

> This game design document describes the details for a 2D side scrolling platformer game where the player makes use of mechanics based on using arrows as platforms to get to the end of the level.
>
> The game will feature a story based on the central America ancient culture (Mayan, Aztec, ...).
>
> The name is not defined yet but the candidate names are:
