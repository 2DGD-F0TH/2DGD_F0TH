Marketing your game
====================


The importance of being pro-consumer
------------------------------------
<!-- Mostly explain that the publisher mentality of "getting all the money" is wrong and not
appliable to small indie developers, and how the success of a game is based more on customer
satisfaction than mere sales -->

We live in a "Money-Driven" world. This is a fact, not an opinion. So, leaving morality out of the discussion, you can argue that the general game publisher mentality of "getting all the money" is not that wrong.
But you don't have to be an idealist to realize that we should see the world for what it could be, and not for what it is at the moment. We should apply this mentality to every aspect of our world, game industry includeed.

We are NOT here to enlight you about how game industry has to change, but every game developer should realize that the true success of a game is NOT based on sales, is based on customer satisfaction. So, even if this cursed "publisher mentality" could be applyed to small indie developers (spoiler: it is not), we have to fight it back, and restore the "customer satisfaction above all" filosofy.
So, fun fact is that the only thing we (small indie delevoper) can do is the right thing to do.

Focus your effort on customer satisfaction, you have to be pro-consumer! 
My first advice is: istead of a thousand features, realize one thing a thousand time better (Bruce Lee style). If you promise the client a shitload of things to do you can generate hype (we'll discuss it later) but if you are an indie (and most of times even if you're not) making one thing extremely enjoyable is way better. Why? Because your goal is to realize something (even if it's only one thing) that will make the customer remember your game: Qality over Quantity.

Satisfying customers is not an easy task, we all know this. So one question you may ask is: How in hell can I be original? Answer is: You don't have to.
So, my second advice: There are million of games out there, creating somenthing never seen before is very, very, very, very difficult. So, try to innovate what alredy exists, make usual features in your own way. This is how sub-generes come to life.
You think this is not the right way? Then go and tell From Software that the "Souls-like" sub-genere was not innovating.

Last advice: Gameplay over Graphics.
We're not Activision, we can't afford to spend 10 million bucks for a cutscene. Aim for the "old fashion gamers", the clients that play for fun, not because some game is gorgeous to see.
Whatever your working on, whatever your game genere is, focus on making the gameplay fun to play. Things are really this simple. Work 2 hours less on a model and 2 hours more on thinking about how to not get your customer bored.


Managing Hype
--------------
<!-- Give the programmer a view on how they are not EA or Ubisoft, and if they
make a bad move (or even an illegal one - see Brutal Force raising prices during sales)
they can't just "take the hit" and walk away with no (or minor) consequences -->

It's time to discuss about promoting our works.
Let's start with an obvious (sadly not that much obvious) statement: We are NOT a big publisher, we cannot afford to make big mistakes.

Truth is that companies like EA, Ubisoft, Square Enix, ActiVision (and many more) can do pretty much evrything they want. Why? Because they know that a massive part of their audience will buy the product "black box", no matther what.

We are not in this situation, so we have to be very cautious. We must be aware that bad moves (not mentioning illegal ones) leads to major consequences, and most of the time indie developers cannot pay this price. 

Most important thing to keep in mind is: never promise without keep your word. This is very important, especially if you're making people pay and the game is not complet yet.
You're not a big publisher, people doesn't trust you and will not pay you for a promise. You have to give them something worth the price, immediatly enjoyable.
Overpricing your game and justify this because of "future release/contents" is NOT going to work eighter.

Patreon could be an interesting compromise for your situation, but you have to use it in the right way, an never abuse your supporters trust. Keep in mind all the basic tips for managing hype we just discuss, and make sure to respect releases/updetes related to a certain amount of income.


Downloadable Content
--------------------------
<!-- Talk how DLC can make or break a game's fame, like how a DLC can extend and
"give new life" to a game, or if a game is broken down and "spoon-fed" to the user
that can be detrimental to its marketing -->

DLC changed the game industry, this is a fact. How? You may ask.
The answer is very simple: it's an excellent way to extend a game lifetime, especially for a single-player games. They are both a way to keep people palying a game (or make people come back) and, at the same time, earning money.

As always there is a good way to do things, and a very bad way.

### DLC: what to avoid

In my opinion there are two major behavior to avoid, besides the obvious "Do NOT overprice". I'll illustrate them, showing some related examples.

**1) Putting the "true" finale in a DLC** This behavior is almost insulting for the customer. Realizing a game and put its finale in a DLC is equal to sell an unfinished product, this is the truth. For a "casual fan" it could matters little, but it's very annoying for a true appassionate of the game/saga. Why? Because youre are implicitly force him to pay twice: The game and his DLC.
Some major game companies exploit this mechanism to simply cut off some content of the orginial game and put it in a DLC: same effort and more income.
I found the pair EA/BioWare to be the major example for this behavior, Dragon Age Inquisition and his DLC "The Tresspasser" jumps immediatly in mind.

**2) Selling a Season Pass "on trust"** With this behavior you're very demanding for yuor customers, things can go really wrong. To put it simple you're selling a Season Pass without presenting the DLC's. Ideally if you're selling a season pass from day 1 than you should, at least, ensure the audience about the number of future DLC and their basic content/quality/quantity.
So what happens if an over-hyped game is released along side with his season pass and the whole thing is quite a flop? That's the case of FFXV. Sqare Enix made quite the gamble, and it really didn't pay off. But Square Enix is Square Enix, so it'll never go bankrupt

### DLC: what to do

Golden rules are:

- Limit DLC to **optional content**. Related to the main story, but not concerning major twists or the finale itself
- Realize DLC's with adeguate game lenght. If your game is a GDR with over 60 hours of content you simply cannot realize a 5 hour DLC
- Realize a Season pass only if you're going to publish at least 3 distinct DLC, or two very big ones.
- Obviously make the customer pay a fair price

I found CD Projekt RED the absolute best company for DLC's. In particular The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt two DLC's have all the good qualities that we want. The adeguate content, a fair price and we're talking about a combined 50 hours of extra game time.



Digital Rights Management (DRM)
------------------------------------
<!-- Talk about how drm can protect your software, but if badly implemented,
it can weigh on your game's performance and even drive away
consumers if it's something known to spy on its users -->



Free-to-Play Economies and LootBoxes
------------------------------------
<!-- Talk about how to avoid predatory EA-style lootboxes and how again microtransactions
can "make or break" a game's fame. How overwatch (Blizzard) implemented a mechanism of
lootboxes that can be (debatably, obviously) considered "acceptable" and how some publishers
are trying to "move the goal further" to earn more money -->

Let's face the most controversial topic, here we go.

### Microtransactions

This is quite the hot topic at the moment: the infamous, devilish microtrantactions. Let's put this clear from the start, microtractions are NOT intrinsically bad.
As always there's a good way and a bad way to make things. In that case the bad way can bring really nasty backfire. 

Microtransactions should be limited to fashion accessories and avatar personalization. Nothing related to game mechanics and gameplay advantages. Everyone **hates** pay to win.

We must acknowledge that there are people willing to pay in order to have some fashion avatar. Microtransactions, and lootboxes as well, should be used for this kind of audience

I found Blizzard to be the best example for good Microtransaction and lootboxes. Overwatch for example presents the best example of lootboxes, giving the audience access only to fashion/customized features for the heroes, like: different skins, animations, vocal sounds.

On the other hand EA, whit the Fifa saga, is the perfect example of how to NOT DO microtransaction/lootboxes. The reason is very simple: Fifa Ultimate Team is the biggest, more money-gaining, pay to win game.

Despite all you could question me, stating that lootboxes are gambling microtransactions. You're right. It's a tricky topic, so it has to be done right, but it's not bad for the sake of existing. Otherwise we should make an inquisition about how people spend their money

### Free-to-Play gaming and Mobile Games

Let's talk a bit about free to play games. 

We cannot approach that topic without speaking a little about mobile games, the very kingdom of free to play gaming.

First of all: **What NOT to do**:

- Make people wait/pay in order to play (All the "energy system", very popular at the moment). Pay to Win are bad, but almost understandable, Pay to Play are simply disgusting
- Make intrusive banners/advertisement, that stops gameplay or reduce screen
- Avoid Pay to Win, especially in a multiplayer game

I also want to give you a major advice about how to use banners/advertising in a smart way:
Let people decide if they want to view an advertisement or not. Especially in a single player game, if you give them a big return (for example double points/coin for next game, or the chance to contiue after a death) the will accept the trade.
This mechanism has two major positives:

- Gamers are NOT annoyed by the use of advertising, they usually see this mechanism as a trade deal: "Do ut des" (I give you, you give me in exchange)
- If they do it once, they're probably going to do it again. At the end they willingly whatch advertisement for you
