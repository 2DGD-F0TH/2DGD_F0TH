Useful Patterns, Containers and Classes
========================================

Observer Pattern
-----------------

The observer pattern is used to implement custom event handling systems, where an object automatically reacts to events generated by another object.

There are 2 main objects used in an observer pattern:

- **The Subject**: sometimes called "Observed Object"
- **The observer**: sometimes called "Dependent Object"

The subject is the creator of a "stream of events" that is consumed by the observer objects.

The subject implements in its structure a list of observers that will be notified when a change occurs, as well as methods to register (add) a new observer as well as to unregister (remove) an existing observer, while the observers will implement a method that will be called by the subject, so that the observers can be notified of such change.

Here we can see an UML diagram of the observer pattern:

Here we can see the Observer abstract class (it can be an interface), a concrete subject and two Concrete Observers that implement what required by the Observer.

Here we can see an implementation of the observer pattern:

\code{patterns_containers/observer}

If needed, you can pass information between the subject and the observers just by calling each `update()` method with the necessary arguments.

Finite State Machine
---------------------

A finite state machine is a model of computation that represents an abstract machine with a finite number of possible states but where one (or a finite number) of states can be "in execution" at a given time.

We can use a finite state machine to represent the status of a player character, like in the following diagram:

![Diagram of a character's state machine](./images/patterns_containers/Character_SM.pdf){width=70%}

Each state machine is made out of two main elements:

- **states** which define a certain state of the system (for the diagram above, the states are: Idle, Crouching, Jumping and Stomping);
- **transitions** which define a condition and the change of state of the machine (for the diagram above there are two "Press Down" transitions, one "Release Down" and one "Press Space")

State machines are really flexible and can be used to represent a menu system, for instance:

![Diagram of a menu system's state machine](./images/patterns_containers/Menu_SM.pdf){width=70%}

In this more convoluted diagram we can see how pressing a certain button or clicking a certain option can trigger a state change.

Each state can be created so it has its own member variables and methods: in a menu system it can prove useful to have each state have its own `update(dt)` and `draw()` functions to be called from the main game loop, to improve on the code readability and better usage of the nutshell programming principle.

Inbetweening
--------

Inbetweening, also known as "tweening", is a method that allows to "smear" a value over time, this is usually done with animations, where you set the beginning and end position of a certain object, as well as the time the movement should take, and let the program take care of the animation.

This is particularly useful in animating *UI*~[g]~ objects, to give a more refined feel to the game.

Here we will present some simple tweenings that can be programmed, and explain them.

Let's start with a *linear* tweening, usually the following function is used:

\code{patterns_containers/tween_linear}

Let's explain the variables used:

- **time**: The current time of the tween. This can be any unit (frames, seconds, steps, ...), as long as it is the same unit as the "duration" variable;
- **begin**: represents the beginning value of the property being inbetweened;
- **change**: represents the change between the beginning and destination value of the property;
- **duration**: represents the duration of the tween.

Note that the measure (time / duration) represents the "percentage of completion" of the tweening.

In some cases a Linear tweening is not enough, that's where *easing* comes into play.

Before introducing easing let's analyze the function again, if you try plugging in some data into the function, you will find that there is always going to be:

$$ (change\ in\ property) \cdot (factor) + (beginning\ value)$$

So we can use our function substituting `begin` with 0 and `change` with 1 to calculate `factor` and have a code similar to this one:

\code{patterns_containers/way_to_easing}

With linear tweening, the function degenerates to $\frac{time}{duration}$, but now we can replace our linear tween with the following function:

\code{patterns_containers/easeIn}

By changing the `power` parameter, we change the behaviour of the easing, making the movement slower at the beginning and pick up the pace more and more, until the destination is reached. This is called a "ease-in".

For an "ease-out", where the animation starts fast and slows down towards the end, we use the following function instead:

\code{patterns_containers/easeOut}

With some calculations, and if statements on the time passed, you can combine the two and get an "ease-in-out" function.

Obviously these functions have an issue: they don't clamp the value between 0 and 1, that will have to be done in the movement function or by adding a check, or using some math, for instance using `min(calculated_value, 1)`.
