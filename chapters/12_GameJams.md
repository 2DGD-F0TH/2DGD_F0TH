Game Jams
==========

Game jams are a great opportunity to test your game making skills in a tight situation, where time is at a premium and you need to "hack your way" through a fully-fledged prototype of a videogame.

In this section there will be some suggestions on how to survive a game jam.

Have Fun
---------

The biggest prize you can get from a Game Jam is experience and comparing yourself to other participants constructively. You shouldn't take part to a game jam just for the prize (although aiming for it could make you strive to do better).

If you don't have fun, then it's probably not worth it.

Stay Healthy
-------------

Don't forget to eat, take regular breaks, go to bed early and just keep some healthy working habits when you're participating a Game Jam.

If you don't keep a healthy work style, your productivity is going to take a dive: you'll find yourself having trouble solving the simplest problems, your creativity will be nonexistent and you'll get extremely frustrated.

Hacking is better than planning (But still plan ahead!)
-------------------------------------------------------

During Game Jams time is at a premium: you shouldn't use complex data structures or be concerned too much about "best practices".

Sometimes "a hack" is better than "a solution": you're building what is essentially a prototype, if the game works and is playable, you have already reached your objective.

You should still plan ahead for your Game Jam experience:

- Make sure your PC is well set up;
- Make sure your development environment works correctly;
- Ensure you can compile some test programs correctly;
- Have a good IDE~[g]~ ready;
- Plan your meals well, the less time you cook, the more time you can rest and think;
- Have a generic roadmap that tells you how much time you want to dedicate to each phase;
- Have some ready-to-use resources to use as placeholders;
- If the game jam allows it, have a basic game structure ready (Like a title screen with a "Play" button).

Graphics? Sounds? Music?
------------------------

When it comes to Game Jams you can't afford to waste much time on graphics or sounds: having a library of ready-to-use resources can prove vital, as well as a good way to test game mechanics while someone else is drawing (if you're participating as a group).

Sometimes it could be better having no graphics at all, to an extent (just see the game: "Thomas was alone", where graphics are rectangles), as long as it doesn't stop the game from being enjoyable.


Focus and don't overdo it
---------------------------

<!-- TODO: Focus on small parts, be essential, don't try to create a fully-fledged RPG or whatever, menus? Nah, credits? Who needs that stuff, etc... -->

Write a Post-Mortem (and read some too!)
----------------------------------------

<!-- TODO: One of the most useful things to do is looking back and see what went well and what didn't. Another good thing is reading about other people's post-mortems -->

Find creativity in limitations
------------------------------

<!-- TODO: It is much harder to find inspiration when you have full freedom: it is usually easier to have a really tight limitation in the subject of the game (example gravity - Newton's gravity, but also something really serious) -->
