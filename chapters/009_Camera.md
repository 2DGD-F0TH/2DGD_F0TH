Cameras
=========

\placeholder

Screen Space vs. Game Space
----------------------------

\placeholder

<!-- TODO: Define what is "screen space" and what is "game/map space",
so we can distinguish between the two while talking about cameras,
also introduce the term "viewport" for "screen space" and talk about how
we can see the actual game as either being the viewport moving on a static map
or the map scrolling under the viewport-->

Static Camera
--------------

\placeholder

<!-- TODO: Simplest: each room is screen-sized, exit a room and the room
gets switched, usually with a fade-to-black -->

Grid Camera
-------------

\placeholder

<!-- TODO: Variation on the static camera, where you scroll on exit (zelda 1 style) -->

Position-Tracking Camera
-------------------------

\placeholder

<!-- TODO: Talk about position tracking cameras, both horizontal-only and 2-axis, can be jarring -->

Camera Trap
-------------

\placeholder

<!-- TODO: Talk about camera traps, rectangular spaces where the character is "trapped inside",
as soon as the player "escapes the trap" the camera scrolls to "trap them again", this allows
for less jarring camera movement. Traps can be small for fast games (sonic) or larger for
slower ones -->

Look-Ahead Camera
-------------------

\placeholder

<!-- TODO: Camera that gives more space in front of the character, allowing for better
reaction times, must be coded well on transitions (between opposite sides) or it can be
extremely confusing or nauseating -->
