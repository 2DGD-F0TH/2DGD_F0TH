Introduction to Game Design
============================

<!--TODO: This section is dedicated to an introduction to platforms and their different challenges, as well as game genres -->
\placeholder


Platforms
----------

\placeholder

### Arcade

\placeholder
<!-- TODO: Arcade cabinets, still quite used, main objective is making you have fun and put quarters -->

### Console

\placeholder
<!-- TODO: Not as flexible as PCs but are gaming-dedicated hardware and have the advantage of being "stable" -->

### Personal Computer

<!-- TODO: Flexible, but you need to choose an API or framework, which can vary performance and beauty -->

\placeholder

### Mobile

<!-- TODO: Portable, everyone has one but also can be challenging cause of how uncomfortable the touchscreen can be -->

\placeholder

### Web

<!-- TODO: Good place for massively multiplayer games (like Agar.io) but limited performance, needs to download the game before running, platform-independent -->

\placeholder

Input Devices
-------------

### Mouse and Keyboard

<!-- TODO: The usual combo for PC, good for FPS, Visual novels and anything that is "made for pc" -->

\placeholder

### Gamepad

<!-- TODO: A classic, goes well for the majority of games, besides point-and-click -->

\placeholder

### Touch Screen

<!-- TODO: Bad to simulate gamepads, good for point-and-click games, since it emulates mouse quite well, but is less precise -->

\placeholder

### Dedicated Hardware

<!-- TODO: Wheels, joysticks, guitar hero guitar, etc... -->

\placeholder

### Other Input Devices

\placeholder

<!-- TODO: gyro, accelerometers, etc... -->

Game Genres
-----------

### Shooters

<!-- TODO: FPS, TPS, Top-down Shooters, anything with a projectile weapon, really -->

\placeholder

### Strategy

<!-- TODO: RTS, TBS, anything in the style of Civilization or Age of Empires -->

\placeholder

### Platformer

<!-- TODO: Any mario game, practically -->

\placeholder

### RPG

<!-- TODO: Role Playing Game, like LoZ or Final Fantasy, can be turn-based or action/adventure -->

\placeholder

### MMO

<!-- TODO: Any game with a massively multiplayer component -->

\placeholder

### Simulation

<!-- TODO: Farming, economy/business, social simulations like the sims, sim city or sim farm... -->

\placeholder

### Rhythm Games

<!--TODO: Based on how precisely you can follow the music beat, can be as simple as DDR or as complex as Crypt of the Necrodancer/Cadence of Hyrule -->

\placeholder

### Visual novels

<!--TODO: Choose-your-own-path graphical adventures that have "telling a story" as their main objective -->
