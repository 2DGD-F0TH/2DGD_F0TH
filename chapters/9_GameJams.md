Game Jams
==========

Game jams are a great opportunity to test your game making skills in a tight situation, where time is at a premium and you need to "hack your way" through a fully-fledged prototype of a videogame.

In this section there will be some suggestions on how to survive a game jam.

Have Fun
---------

<!-- TODO: Game jams should not be participated "for the prize", cause the biggest prize is experience -->

Stay Healthy
-------------

<!-- TODO: Don't forget to eat, take breaks, go to bed early, productivity takes a dive when you're not doing well physically -->

Hacking is better than planning
-------------------------------

<!-- TODO: Time is at a premium, don't use complex structures, good practices or whatever, it's just a prototype -->

Focus and don't overdo it
---------------------------

<!-- TODO: Focus on small parts, be essential, don't try to create a fully-fledged RPG or whatever, menus? Nah, credits? Who needs that stuff, etc... -->

Write a Post-Mortem (and read some too!)
----------------------------------------

<!-- TODO: One of the most useful things to do is looking back and see what went well and what didn't. Another good thing is reading about other people's post-mortems -->

Find creativity in limitations
------------------------------

<!-- TODO: It is much harder to find inspiration when you have full freedom: it is usually easier to have a really tight limitation in the subject of the game (example gravity - Newton's gravity, but also something really serious) -->
